caught a break last week president donald trump issued an executive order that partly targets a key provision of the inflation reduction act that allows with manufacturers he proposed a change that the pharmaceutical industry has long sought in the wideranging order trump directed health and human services secretary robert f kennedy jr to work with congress to modify a piece of the medicare drug price negotiation rules which differentiate between smallmolecule drugs and biologic medicines currently the law essentially spares biologics like vaccines from new negotiated prices for years after they receive us approval compared with just nine years for smallmolecule drugs that come in a pill or tablet form the industry contends that the discrepancy or what drugmakers call the pill penalty discourages companies from investing in the development of smallmolecule drugs which are generally cheaper easier to manufacture and more convenient for patients to take trumps executive order saying the discrepancy threatens to distort innovation lawmakers on both sides of the aisle could be receptive to the proposed change especially after some last year that also seeks to eliminate the difference it could have huge implications for drugmakers patients and medicares spending on prescription drugs an from the health policy research organization kff said the change would mean smallmolecule drugs would be on the market longer before they are eligible for negotiations which could lead to an increase in medicare prescription drug spending higher medication prices and steeper premiums in medicare part d plans changing the law would come at a cost to medicare and beneficiaries by giving drug companies additional years of setting their own prices on these drugs prior to being eligible for negotiation by the federal government unless combined with other changes to prevent higher spending the analysis said more than half of the drugs out of in the first and second rounds of negotiations would have been ineligible at the time they were selected if the discrepancy between smallmolecule treatments and biologics didnt exist according to kff those drugs accounted for about twothirds of total gross medicare part d spending on the treatments or billion out of billion kff said that includes the blood thinner eliquis from and as well as the type diabetes treatment jardiance from eli lilly and boehringer ingelheim would be among the biggest beneficiaries if the pill penalty is removed according to a thursday note from td cowen analyst michael nedelcovych at the top of the list of drugs are the companys blockbuster diabetes injection ozempic weight loss shot wegovy and diabetes pill rybelsus which are considered one product for the sake of the negotiations since they all share the same active ingredient semaglutide without the socalled pill penalty ozempic wegovy and rybelsus would not be eligible until which is only one year before patent expiration in the us nedelcovych said trumps wasnt all good news for pharma analysts pointed out that it contained other proposals that the pharmaceutical industry has strongly opposed for example it calls on the food and drug administration to open up a pathway for more drug imports from canada where prescription medications are far cheaper that was an element of trumps firstterm agenda and appears to clash

blast and the colorful rainbow of skittles may soon be dimmed the food and drug administration is phasing out the use of petroleumbased synthetic dyes by the end of next year the agency announced on tuesday for the last years american children have increasingly been living in a toxic soup of synthetic chemicals fda commissioner marty makary said at a press conference food and beverage companies use additives like red dye to give cereal chips sports drinks and other products bright hues that attract shoppers but backlash against artificial colorants has been brewing in the us for more than a decade the changes will affect a slew of food giants including mars and the industry has argued that the claims about the dangers of artificial dyes lack evidence that would support any bans as of tuesday the fda and the food industry dont have a formal agreement to remove artificial dyes but instead an understanding according to health secretary robert f kennedy jr it is unclear what enforcement actions the agency would take if food and beverage companies do not comply there are a number of tools at our disposal makary said i believe in love lets start in a friendly way and see if we can do this without any statutory or regulatory changes but we are exploring every tool in the toolbox to make sure this gets done very quickly and they want to do it so why go down a complicated road with congress the fda is taking several actions including setting a national standard and timeline for the food industry to transition from petroleumbased food dyes to natural alternatives according to makary the agency is also initiating a process to revoke authorization of synthetic food colorings including those not in production within the coming weeks he added that the fda is also eliminating the remaining six synthetic dyes on the market from the us food supply by the end of the year specifically red dye yellow dye yellow dye blue dye blue dye and green dye it is also requesting food companies to phase out red dye by the end of next year which is sooner than the to deadline previously announced according to makary for companies that are currently using petroleum based red dye try watermelon juice or beet juice for companies currently combining petroleumbased yellow chemical and red dyes together try carrot juice he said makary added that the agency plans to authorize four additional color additives using natural ingredients in the coming weeks while also expediting the review and approval of other natural ingredient colors makary cited a that concluded that artificial colors in the diet result in increased hyperactivity the f in fda stands for food he said now theres no one ingredient that accounts for the child chronic disease epidemic and lets be honest taking petroleumbased food dyes out of the food supply is not a silver bullet that will instantly make americas children healthy but it is one important step last month kennedy that removing artificial dyes from the food system is an urgent priority of the trump administration meeting attendees included the ceos of pepsico north america kraft heinz general mills tyson foods wk kellogg jm smucker and the consumer brands association the industrys top trade group kennedy has used kelloggs froot loops as his primary example when railing against artificial colorants while it is unclear exactly how removing dyes could affect the companies businesses it will be a major effort to overhaul recipes and the new looks could affect how consumers perceive the products makary said phasing out petroleumbased food dyes wont increase food prices pointing to other countries that have made similar moves however synthetic dyes are generally more costeffective than natural alternatives which often require larger quantities to achieve vibrant colors and can carry higher production costs according to some and previously pushback from consumer advocates led some of the companies to tweak their formulas and drop artificial dyes without any government intervention in changed the recipe of its trademark mac and cheese to use the same natural colors found in the european version of the product but the changes dont always stick in course putting its artificially colored trix cereal back on shelves the naturally dyed cereal which used turmeric radishes and purple carrots was not as

the end of the company said that will be driven in large part by enhanced digital enablement including automation and artificial intelligence and streamlining business processes the expanded cuts also

slash costs with the first phase of the effort slated to deliver billion in savings by the end of with the added cuts announced tuesday pfizer now expects to deliver around billion in savings by the end of that year from the two costcutting efforts the cuts aim to help the pharmaceutical giant recover from the rapid decline of its covid business and stock price over the last few years and appear to be paying off heres what the company reported for the compared with what wall street was expecting based on a survey of analysts by lseg the results come as drugmakers brace for president s planned tariffs on pharmaceuticals imported into the us his administrations bid to boost us manufacturing of medications unlike other companies grappling with evolving trade policy pfizer did not revise its outlook the company maintained its fullyear outlook forecasting sales of billion to billion with a similar performance from its covid products as seen in however pfizer noted in its earnings release that the guidance does not currently include any potential impact related to future tariffs and trade policy changes which we are unable to predict at this time but on the earnings call on tuesday pfizer executives said the guidance does reflect million in costs from trumps existing tariffs included in our guidance that we didnt really speak about is there are some tariffs in place today pfizer cfo dave denton said on the call we are contemplating that within our guidance range and we continue to again trend to the top end of our guidance range even with those costs to be incurred this year he said on the call pfizer ceo albert bourla said the company established a team to analyze a range of potential outcomes and develop strategies to help mitigate the potential impact of tariffs on its business in the short and long term that team is managing current inventory levels in certain jurisdictions and leveraging pfizers domestic manufacturing footprint among other efforts should we be impacted by further tariffs in the future we will assess the impact of the policies enacted and provide information at the appropriate time bourla said he added that uncertainty around trumps

sales by billion dampening growth by approximately compared with stripping out onetime items the company expects earnings to be in the range of to a share with the underlying strength of our business we believe we can be agile in navigating an uncertain and volatile external environment bourla said in a release for the first quarter the company booked net income of billion or cents per share that compares with net income of billion or cents per share during the same period a year ago excluding certain items including restructuring charges and costs associated with intangible assets the company posted earnings per share of cents for the quarter pfizer reported revenue of billion for the first quarter down from the same period a year ago the company said the decrease in sales was primarily driven by a decline in revenue for paxlovid which posted million in sales during the first quarter down from the same period a year ago in part due to lower covid infections worldwide and reduced international government purchases of the drug the drop in sales also reflects a boost pfizer got in the first quarter of from a final adjustment related to a previously recorded revenue reversal for paxlovid analysts had expected paxlovid to generate million in sales for the first quarter according to streetaccount estimates meanwhile the companys covid shot comirnaty booked million in revenue up from the same period a year ago thats above the million that analysts were expecting according to streetaccount the results come as shot makers like pfizer face uncertainty over immunization policy

{"title": "the outdated healthcare idea thats holding women back in life and careers", "description": "", "content": "twentyfive years ago joanna strober invested in a company called babycenter twentyfive years later the company is still serving women a lot of women strober says she was a pregnant venture investor at the time she made the babycenter investment and it helped to spark a bigger idea for too long she says the storyline for women facing challenges has been just deal with it its a weird thing and thats just really unhealthy and we have to change that strober said at the recent cnbc changemakers summit in los angeles for chelsea hirschhorn having her first child led her to become totally disillusioned with the chasm between the image of new parenthood that was marketed and the reality she experienced the pictureperfect image of parenting was overwhelming for a new parent she said there was a big dichotomy between the content i was consuming and the frontline experience at am hirschhorn says there was no data available at the time to substantiate what she felt because the topic was understudied and underfunded so she took on the category of infant health and wellness for whatever reason hirschhorn says she had the conviction to think i could fix this while there is a distinction between the health challenges the two female ceo and founders focus on not every woman will become pregnant but all will go through menopause one big idea binds the two women leaders together products treatments and services exist that can meet critical needs in an underserved and undervalued market we have this idea that perimenopause is at a certain time and people think they have to suffer for a really long time before they get the right care but what we say is you dont have to suffer at all strober shared at the changemakers summit as soon as youre in your s and anything starts feeling wrong you should get help the idea of suffering is really outdated she said women have been trained to suffer for far too long and were both named to the actress and entrepreneur who has become a leading advocate for menopause health as founder and chief creative officer at stripes beauty after struggling with early menopause at the height of her early hollywood fame was also among the changemakers at the changemakers summit on april the two women ceos shared advice and lessons from their successes bringing new business ideas to health care here are a few of the key themes they touched on in a discussion with cnbcs kate rooney in addition to the dearth of information that exists to prepare women for the reality of parenthood educational content for women has been censored when on topics related to reproductive health that was something that hirschhorn learned once she started frida a time when it was almost impossible she says to find authentic storytelling on the subject matter and led her to create sixty percent of womens health ads content or content in general has been in some way shape or form rejected or filtered she said thats not just online but on linear television part of what hirschhorn calls a very gendered dichotomy citing the fact that male health and sexual wellness content is approved at a significantly higher rate that leaves her incredulous she said and it is a call to action to shift from womens health being a topic of provocation to a topic of public health women have to advocate for themselves she said women cant be complacent and this goes beyond health care this can drive real change in retail in every facet of life she added strober noted that when she was building midi health it became clear that a major challenge would be working with codes created by the insurance industry for menopause in effect another form of institutional censorship midi health decided to position itself as an innetwork primary care provider that had a specialty in menopause and that turned out to be a really effective way to gain traction she says and it now has nationwide insurance coverage with all the large insurance companies in the us they are not necessarily going to cover sexual health issues but they will cover primary care so you just subsume it she explained by viewing menopause as just part of womens health she says the company was able to create a reimbursement mechanism that meets insurance standards that insurance coverage is a very big deal because research is showing that lack of menopause treatment can have a high cost when it comes to womens careers strober pointed to during the changemakers discussion found that at the midcareer moment when women should be gaining their greatest successes in the workplace the shift into menopause can hold them back strober said the growing body of research details how menopause can result in discrimination at work with women quitting jobs or not going for raises or promotions because of symptoms and also because they dont believe they can get the treatment that they need if you believe that you have something that cant be fixed its very embarrassing and that means people step back from what they are doing strober said they are scared she added that can be the experience that is called brain fog and also hot flashes you lose power during hot flashes strober said people are not as confident but if you are getting treated for it its just a hot flash and you can regain power she added hirschhorn says that by the numbers there is still huge potential in the womens health market it is estimated to grow to billion by according to data she cited at the event and that is despite the fact that less than of healthcare rd spending and investment goes to the category a seismic gap she said it is a wellknown fact in consumer research that women dominate household spending but hirschhorn said in fridas market there is a viral opportunity that is underappreciated creating products for women based on real need creates a virality that is hard to recreate with other demographics she said these women arent just buying their products they are selling them to their communities and friends we call that word of mom hirschhorn said its a really big untapped opportunity she added as a former venture investor strober said it is important to accept that people are not dying to invest in womens health but she added that when you can show the growth that companies like midi health are posting that wont slow a company down we are the fastestgrowing digital health company probably ever quite honestly she said we are growing insanely fast because women really need access to this care and cant get it elsewhere she added similar to the virality experienced by frida strober says the business model does build on itself once you take care of one thing for women they come back to you for something else and if you develop this trusted platform for them where they become your longterm patient that is a good business she said we dont say its a womens business we say its a really good business she added that opportunity and the unfiltered realities of parenthood have now grown frida to more than products covering everything from conception to postpartum and breastfeeding care and beyond my four children are a hotbed of inspiration and my snot sucking days are almost over hirschhorn said but she added the same problems exist you just need a different toolkit at midi health strober says the next big opportunity to unlock is making connections between menopause health and longevity if you take care of yourself in your s you can really prevent a lot of the diseases that come in your s and so we have been thinking a lot about this longevity market strober said its all bros all the bros who are out there and talking about wanting to live to we just want to take care of ourselves we dont care about living to we just want to be healthy grandmas she said what do we do how do we take care of our brains and bones and hearts to age in a healthy way strober asks she says there are many treatments products and services yet to be developed by health companies that will help women in their s s and s to better answer that

significant share of workers at those offices or in some cases all of them along with their directors the people said the affected units include the hhs office of minority health and the national

for medicare medicaid services the health resources and services administration and the substance abuse and mental health services administration according to the people health policy experts told

often face worse health outcomes such as lower life expectancy and higher rates of infant mortality and chronic disease and more limited access to care and other resources than the us population as a

research and analysis to help lower costs and reduce the incidence and severity of chronic diseases in the us nearly all staff at the cdcs office of minority health were cut according to the people to adhere to the letter of the law the trump administration is considering reconstituting that unit and the office of womens health so that each office would be made up of at least one director or a very small group of employees the people said the agencys office of minority health works across cdc to promote research of health disparities and create programs to improve the health of racial and ethnic minority groups at the fdas office of minority health and health equity all staff were cut the people said the future of that office is unclear the unit focuses on efforts such as increasing clinical trial diversity improving transparency around how medical products affect different populations and creating health resources tailored to a range of languages and cultures no staff are left at hrsas office of health equity after the layoffs as well as some retirements and reassignments according to the people that office leads efforts to reduce disparities in healthcare access quality and outcomes through hrsa which focuses on people who are uninsured geographically isolated or economically and medically vulnerable the future of that office is also unclear apart from the trump administrations plans to fold hrsa into kennedys new agency the same goes for samhsas which saw all remaining staff cut except for a new recently hired director according to the people the office also had a retirement and one worker on probation who was put on administrative leave the office works to ensure that samhsas resources for mental health and substance abuse treatment including grant programs and other initiatives are equitably distributed across all communities and populations roughly a third of staff are gone at nimhd some of whom were laid off and others who left due to early retirements and buyouts the people said some workers on probation were put on leave several weeks before kennedy started cuts they said the institutes deputy director accepted an offer to be acting director in the short term the people added nimhd which is part of the national institutes of health works to reduce health disparities through conducting and funding research and developing new programs the hhs office of minority health also faced cuts though its unclear how many staff were impacted the people said that office leads the federal effort to improve health outcomes for racial and ethnic minority groups developing policies and programs and providing funding it will likely take several months to a year before the us sees direct consequences from the cuts to nimhd and the offices said terry mcgovern professor at the cuny graduate school of public health and health policy but the staff reductions could cause the us to lose out on crucial data which is the cornerstone for addressing health disparities according to samantha artiga director for the racial equity and health policy program at kff a health policy research organization artiga said data and research are essential for pinpointing where disparities exist understanding their root causes crafting effective solutions and tracking progress over time for example data can reveal whether certain groups experience worse surgical outcomes or wait longer at the emergency room or if a vaccination program is being equitably distributed across regions without focused data and research those disparities may remain unseen and unaddressed creating blind spots artiga said adding that the us would eventually have to rebuild that knowledge in the future the fate of many of the grants that nimhd and some of the offices provide is unclear that includes from hhs office of minority health to organizations for a fouryear initiative to identify strategies that increase the use of preventive health services in communities but if offices cut back that funding or stop it altogether it could also weaken the nations ability to reduce health disparities boston universitys ettinger de cuba said communitybased organizations rely on federal money to deliver culturally tailored care to different groups and could be forced to scale back or shut down programs the loss of grants could also stall research innovation and public health interventions by outside entities such as universities healthcare systems and social service organizations philanthropy is not able to step up at this level long term the only actor thats able to do that is the government ettinger de cuba said nathan boucher research professor at dukes sanford school of public policy added that the cuts will degrade any effort of these larger governmental organizations to have any accountability when it comes to protecting the people they help and serve every day while kennedy has said his cuts are focused on making hhs more responsive and efficient boucher said targeting minority health offices could do the opposite i actually think its an efficiency argument to be able to have these minority health offices because it allows you to identify and target some real problem areas and use taxpayer dollars in the most efficient way possible said boucher", "author": null, "publishedAt": "", "source": "", "url":

plans to appeal the company did not provide a revenue forecast for the year cvs said it is maintaining a cautious view for the remainder of the year in light of continued higher medical costs and the potential for macro headwinds we got smarter about the markets that we wanted and the lives that we wanted to compete for and so we actually have planned and budgeted for the elevated trends cvs ceo david joyner said in an interview with cnbc referring to markets that the insurance unit operates in and higher medical costs so i think why youre not seeing a surprise on our part is because we actually plan for elevated trends going into this year he added joyner said the company is watching for the potential impact from president s planned tariffs on pharmaceuticals imported into the us on the pharmacy side i think it is highly dependent on what happens in the next week or two when they announce the implications of tariffs on the manufacturers he told cnbc joyner added that the vast majority of the companys retail products at the front of stores are sourced in the us which should be a benefit for us heres what cvs reported for the first quarter compared with what wall street was

return to hospitals for procedures they delayed during the pandemic but for the first time in several quarters cvs insurance business appeared to show some signs of improvement the units medical benefit ratio a measure of total medical expenses paid relative to premiums collected decreased to from a year earlier a lower ratio typically indicates that a company collected more in premiums than it paid out in benefits resulting in higher profitability cvs said the move partly reflects stronger underlying performance in its medicare business and improved medicare advantage star ratings for the payment year those ratings help patients compare the quality of medicare health and drug plans i think that investment and talent that allowed us to focus on both the execution and the operation actually helped establish the performance that youre seeing joyner said referring to an executive reshuffling last year that tapped a new leader for the insurance unit and other parts of the business

can go all the way said paul kruszewski a former hinge employee who joined the company after it acquired his canadian computer vision startup wrnch in employees say perez is a voracious reader often finishing two to four books a month that includes books about business and leadership an important source of information given that hinge was his first real job hes a fan of the innovators

hes ever experienced another danism as sturm called it is hinges philosophy around writing perez has employees write memos typically up to six pages long instead of preparing slide decks or other materials ahead of meetings perez was inspired by a similar practice at according to current and former employees and sees it as a way to force employees to think through what they want to say instead of hiding behind bullet points hinges memo culture can be an adjustment particularly for new employees sturm said he thought the practice was insane at first but ultimately came to appreciate it and said it improved his pitches when you sort of sit back you go you know actually he wasnt wrong sturm said hinge has come a long way since venture firm atomico led the million series a investment in

sizable business in digital health despite having so many odds stacked against it lots of learnings along the way of course like a big tech correction in the middle brochado said in an interview but it really is one of those rare examples of just an enormous market that was under penetrated for david perez whose firm now serves as hinges outside counsel watching the startup grow has been

losing its strong grip on the booming weight loss market heres a recap of what sparked the panic on thursday if you missed it s pharmacy benefit manager caremark said it s wegovy on its standard formularies on july making that weekly injection the preferred glp drug for obesity as part of the move caremark will also drop eli lillys weight loss drug zepbound from those formularies which represent tens of millions of patients caremark negotiated an undisclosed lower net price for wegovy over zepbound on its standard formularies offering savings on novo nordisks drug to clients that opt into those plans but employers and unions will ultimately determine how much of those savings on wegovy get shared with members cvs said wegovys list price before insurance is for a months supply while zepbounds is that decision by one of the nations largest pbms triggered fears of a price war in the weight loss drug market and concerns that zepbounds sales momentum could stall shares of eli lilly plunged on thursday but several wall street analysts said the selloff was overblown in our view the novocvs deal does not represent the beginning of an obesity pricing war between lilly novo bmo capital markets analyst evan seigerman said in a note on thursday he added that in discussions with the companies both lilly and novo emphasized they want to expand patient access not undercut each other on price that may be reassuring to investors worried that a price war could hurt profit margins but the high list price of those weight loss drugs may remain a major barrier for many patients particularly those whose health plans dont cover the medications eli lilly told the firm it is not interested in exclusive oneofone deals with pbms while novo nordisk said cvs approached the drugmaker about the wegovy agreement according to seigerman on an earnings call on thursday eli lilly ceo david ricks said the company has been trying to move away from setting high list prices and paying bigger rebates to pbms for preferential coverage instead eli lilly is trying to set list prices closer to what it expects the plans to pay for its drugs we have been very vocal about trying to move away from that ricks said referring to deep pbm rebates he added that zepbound is still growing market share seigerman agreed saying that eli lilly is continuing to perform where it matters zepbound and the companys diabetes drug mounjaro now make up over half of us glp prescriptions outpacing the combined share of novo nordisks wegovy and its diabetes treatment ozempic according to seigerman that marketshare traction clearly demonstrates that physicians and patients prefer zepbound over wegovy bernstein analyst courtney breen wrote in a separate note on thursday its unclear how much the cvs formulary change will appeal to employers especially given that zepbound is known to be more effective at promoting weight loss than wegovy some patients on the standard formularies may also try to stay on their current zepbound prescriptions by requesting exemptions jpmorgan analyst chris schott said in a thursday note eli lillys ricks also said cvs move mainly affects smaller employers who are more likely to stick with caremarks standard formularies larger companies covering more patients often use customized formularies meaning they can still decide to include zepbound regardless the cvswegovy deal overshadowed for eli lilly the companys firstquarter revenue and earnings topped estimates on skyrocketing demand for zepbound and mounjaro both of which raked in billions of dollars in

caught a break last week president donald trump issued an executive order that partly targets a key provision of the inflation reduction act that allows with manufacturers he proposed a change that the pharmaceutical industry has long sought in the wideranging order trump directed health and human services secretary robert f kennedy jr to work with congress to modify a piece of the medicare drug price negotiation rules which differentiate between smallmolecule drugs and biologic medicines currently the law essentially spares biologics like vaccines from new negotiated prices for years after they receive us approval compared with just nine years for smallmolecule drugs that come in a pill or tablet form the industry contends that the discrepancy or what drugmakers call the pill penalty discourages companies from investing in the development of smallmolecule drugs which are generally cheaper easier to manufacture and more convenient for patients to take trumps executive order saying the discrepancy threatens to distort innovation lawmakers on both sides of the aisle could be receptive to the proposed change especially after some last year that also seeks to eliminate the difference it could have huge implications for drugmakers patients and medicares spending on prescription drugs an from the health policy research organization kff said the change would mean smallmolecule drugs would be on the market longer before they are eligible for negotiations which could lead to an increase in medicare prescription drug spending higher medication prices and steeper premiums in medicare part d plans changing the law would come at a cost to medicare and beneficiaries by giving drug companies additional years of setting their own prices on these drugs prior to being eligible for negotiation by the federal government unless combined with other changes to prevent higher spending the analysis said more than half of the drugs out of in the first and second rounds of negotiations would have been ineligible at the time they were selected if the discrepancy between smallmolecule treatments and biologics didnt exist according to kff those drugs accounted for about twothirds of total gross medicare part d spending on the treatments or billion out of billion kff said that includes the blood thinner eliquis from and as well as the type diabetes treatment jardiance from eli lilly and boehringer ingelheim would be among the biggest beneficiaries if the pill penalty is removed according to a thursday note from td cowen analyst michael nedelcovych at the top of the list of drugs are the companys blockbuster diabetes injection ozempic weight loss shot wegovy and diabetes pill rybelsus which are considered one product for the sake of the negotiations since they all share the same active ingredient semaglutide without the socalled pill penalty ozempic wegovy and rybelsus would not be eligible until which is only one year before patent expiration in the us nedelcovych said trumps wasnt all good news for pharma analysts pointed out that it contained other proposals that the pharmaceutical industry has strongly opposed for example it calls on the food and drug administration to open up a pathway for more drug imports from canada where prescription medications are far cheaper that was an element of trumps firstterm agenda and appears to clash

blast and the colorful rainbow of skittles may soon be dimmed the food and drug administration is phasing out the use of petroleumbased synthetic dyes by the end of next year the agency announced on tuesday for the last years american children have increasingly been living in a toxic soup of synthetic chemicals fda commissioner marty makary said at a press conference food and beverage companies use additives like red dye to give cereal chips sports drinks and other products bright hues that attract shoppers but backlash against artificial colorants has been brewing in the us for more than a decade the changes will affect a slew of food giants including mars and the industry has argued that the claims about the dangers of artificial dyes lack evidence that would support any bans as of tuesday the fda and the food industry dont have a formal agreement to remove artificial dyes but instead an understanding according to health secretary robert f kennedy jr it is unclear what enforcement actions the agency would take if food and beverage companies do not comply there are a number of tools at our disposal makary said i believe in love lets start in a friendly way and see if we can do this without any statutory or regulatory changes but we are exploring every tool in the toolbox to make sure this gets done very quickly and they want to do it so why go down a complicated road with congress the fda is taking several actions including setting a national standard and timeline for the food industry to transition from petroleumbased food dyes to natural alternatives according to makary the agency is also initiating a process to revoke authorization of synthetic food colorings including those not in production within the coming weeks he added that the fda is also eliminating the remaining six synthetic dyes on the market from the us food supply by the end of the year specifically red dye yellow dye yellow dye blue dye blue dye and green dye it is also requesting food companies to phase out red dye by the end of next year which is sooner than the to deadline previously announced according to makary for companies that are currently using petroleum based red dye try watermelon juice or beet juice for companies currently combining petroleumbased yellow chemical and red dyes together try carrot juice he said makary added that the agency plans to authorize four additional color additives using natural ingredients in the coming weeks while also expediting the review and approval of other natural ingredient colors makary cited a that concluded that artificial colors in the diet result in increased hyperactivity the f in fda stands for food he said now theres no one ingredient that accounts for the child chronic disease epidemic and lets be honest taking petroleumbased food dyes out of the food supply is not a silver bullet that will instantly make americas children healthy but it is one important step last month kennedy that removing artificial dyes from the food system is an urgent priority of the trump administration meeting attendees included the ceos of pepsico north america kraft heinz general mills tyson foods wk kellogg jm smucker and the consumer brands association the industrys top trade group kennedy has used kelloggs froot loops as his primary example when railing against artificial colorants while it is unclear exactly how removing dyes could affect the companies businesses it will be a major effort to overhaul recipes and the new looks could affect how consumers perceive the products makary said phasing out petroleumbased food dyes wont increase food prices pointing to other countries that have made similar moves however synthetic dyes are generally more costeffective than natural alternatives which often require larger quantities to achieve vibrant colors and can carry higher production costs according to some and previously pushback from consumer advocates led some of the companies to tweak their formulas and drop artificial dyes without any government intervention in changed the recipe of its trademark mac and cheese to use the same natural colors found in the european version of the

that the guidance does not currently include any potential impact related to future tariffs and trade policy changes which we are unable to predict at this time but on the earnings call on tuesday

posted earnings per share of cents for the quarter pfizer reported revenue of billion for the first quarter down from the same period a year ago the company said the decrease in sales was primarily driven by a decline in revenue for paxlovid which posted million in sales during the first quarter down from the same period a year ago in part due to lower covid infections worldwide and reduced international government purchases of the drug the drop in sales also reflects a boost pfizer got in the first quarter of from a final adjustment related to a previously recorded revenue reversal for

{"title": "the outdated healthcare idea thats holding women back in life and careers", "description": "", "content": "twentyfive years ago joanna strober invested in a company called babycenter twentyfive years later the company is still serving women a lot of women strober says she was a pregnant venture investor at the time she made the babycenter investment and it helped to spark a bigger idea for too long she says the storyline for women facing challenges has been just deal with it its a weird thing and thats just really unhealthy and we have to change that strober said at the recent cnbc changemakers summit in los angeles for chelsea hirschhorn having her first child led her to become totally disillusioned with the chasm between the image of new parenthood that was marketed and the reality she experienced the pictureperfect image of parenting was overwhelming for a new parent she said there was a big dichotomy between the content i was consuming and the frontline experience at am hirschhorn says there was no data available at the time to substantiate what she felt because the topic was understudied and underfunded so she took on the category of infant health and wellness for whatever reason hirschhorn says she had the conviction to think i could fix this while there is a distinction between the health challenges the two female ceo and founders focus on not every woman will become pregnant but all will go through menopause one big idea binds the two women leaders together products treatments and services exist that can meet critical needs in an underserved and undervalued market we have this idea that perimenopause is at a certain time and people think they have to suffer for a really long time before they get the right care but what we say is you dont have to suffer at all strober shared at the changemakers summit as soon as youre in your s and anything starts feeling wrong you should get help the idea of suffering is really outdated she said women have been trained to suffer for far too long and were both named to the actress and entrepreneur who has become a leading advocate for menopause health as founder and chief creative officer at stripes beauty after struggling with early menopause at the height of her early hollywood fame was also among the changemakers at the changemakers summit on april the two women ceos shared advice and lessons from their successes bringing new business ideas to health care here are a few of the key themes they touched on in a discussion with cnbcs kate rooney in addition to the dearth of information that exists to prepare women for the reality of parenthood educational content for women has been censored when on topics related to reproductive health that was something that hirschhorn learned once she started frida a time when it was almost impossible she says to find authentic storytelling on the subject matter and led her to create sixty percent of womens health ads content or content in general has been in some way shape or form rejected or filtered she said thats not just online but on linear television part of what hirschhorn calls a very gendered dichotomy citing the fact that male health and sexual wellness content is approved at a significantly higher rate that leaves her incredulous she said and it is a call to action to shift from womens health being a topic of provocation to a topic of public health women have to advocate for themselves she said women cant be complacent and this goes beyond health care this can drive real change in retail in every facet of life she added strober noted that when she was building midi health it became clear that a major challenge would be working with codes created by the insurance industry for menopause in effect another form of institutional censorship midi health decided to position itself as an innetwork primary care provider that had a specialty in menopause and that turned out to be a really effective way to gain traction she says and it now has nationwide insurance coverage with all the large insurance companies in the us they are not necessarily going to cover sexual health issues but they will cover primary care so you just subsume it she explained by viewing menopause as just part of womens health she says the company was able to create a reimbursement mechanism that meets insurance standards that insurance coverage is a very big deal because research is showing that lack of menopause treatment can have a high cost when it comes to womens careers strober pointed to during the changemakers discussion found that at the midcareer moment when women should be gaining their greatest successes in the workplace the shift into menopause can hold them back strober said the growing body of research details how menopause can result in discrimination at work with women quitting jobs or not going for raises or promotions because of symptoms and also because they dont believe they can get the treatment that they need if you believe that you have something that cant be fixed its very embarrassing and that means people step back from what they are doing strober said they are scared she added that can be the experience that is called brain fog and also hot flashes you lose power during hot flashes strober said people are not as confident but if you are getting treated for it its just a hot flash and you can regain power she added hirschhorn says that by the numbers there is still huge potential in the womens health market it is estimated to grow to billion by according to data she cited at the event and that is despite the fact that less than of healthcare rd spending and investment goes to the category a seismic gap she said it is a wellknown fact in consumer research that women dominate household spending but hirschhorn said in fridas market there is a viral opportunity that is underappreciated creating products for women based on real need creates a virality that is hard to recreate with other demographics she said these women arent just buying their products they are selling them to their communities and friends we call that word of mom hirschhorn said its a really big untapped opportunity she added as a former venture investor strober said it is important to accept that people are not dying to invest in womens health but she added that when you can show the growth that companies like midi health are posting that wont slow a company down we are the fastestgrowing digital health company probably ever quite honestly she said we are growing insanely fast because women really need access to this care and cant get it elsewhere she added similar to the virality experienced by frida strober says the business model does build on itself once you take care of one thing for women they come back to you for something else and if you develop this trusted platform for them where they become your longterm patient that is a good business she said we dont say its a womens business we say its a really good business she added that opportunity and the unfiltered realities of parenthood have now grown frida to more than products covering everything from conception to postpartum and breastfeeding care and beyond my four children are a hotbed of inspiration and my snot sucking days are almost over hirschhorn said but she added the same problems exist you just need a different toolkit at midi health strober says the next big opportunity to unlock is making connections between menopause health and longevity if you take care of yourself in your s you can really prevent a lot of the diseases that come in your s and so we have been thinking a lot about this longevity market strober said its all bros all the bros who are out there and talking about wanting to live to we just want to take care of ourselves we dont care about living to we just want to be healthy grandmas she said what do we do how do we take care of our brains and bones and hearts

{"title": "rfk jr is gutting hhs offices that are key to reducing health disparities", "description": "", "content": "robert f kennedy jrs of the department of health and human services involves deep cuts to several divisions that help protect and improve the health of minority and underserved populations and eliminate health disparities in the us cnbc has learned kennedy the health and human services secretary has gutted at least seven minority health offices across the department according to people familiar with the matter who requested anonymity to speak freely hhs has laid off a significant share of workers at those offices or in some cases all of them along with their directors the people said the affected units include the hhs office of minority health and the national institute on minority health and health disparities or the cuts also hit offices with similar functions at the food and drug administration the centers for disease control and prevention the centers for medicare medicaid services the health resources and services administration and the substance abuse and mental health services administration according to the people health policy experts told cnbc that deep cuts to those divisions could widen existing health disparities in the us undoing years of progress toward addressing them over time that could worsen health outcomes for already underserved groups threaten overall public health strain the us healthcare system and drive up healthcare costs it will have negative health impacts obviously for groups that theyre focused on so racial and ethnic minorities but i think what gets missed in the story is it ultimately impacts all of us no matter what your background is dr stephanie ettinger de cuba research professor of health law policy and management at boston university told cnbc its not a zerosum game so i think thats what is deeply disturbing to me as we are going to see people get hurt she said decimating or cutting staff from these offices ultimately makes it worse for everyone the trump administration cant shutter the affected offices entirely which would since they were authorized by the affordable care act more than a decade ago the people said the exact fate of each office and the nih institute is unclear they added the administration likely hopes to at least narrow the scope of what nimhd and the agency offices do curtailing their authority and limiting resources said brandyn churchill professor of public administration and policy at american university the cuts come as health disparities remain a major challenge in the us affecting not only people of color but also rural residents lowincome communities and individuals with disabilities among several other groups these communities often face worse health outcomes such as lower life expectancy and higher rates of infant mortality and chronic disease and more limited access to care and other resources than the us population as a whole the covid pandemic deepened many of these gaps highlighting how the long us history of exclusionary policies and systemic issues such as poverty and racism contribute to unequal health outcomes across the country health policy experts stress that addressing those disparities leads to stronger overall public health as healthier communities improve outcomes for everyone it could also relieve a huge economic burden on the us a found that racial and ethnic health disparities cost the us economy billion in kennedy is consolidating divisions and slashing jobs at hhs that oversees vaccines and other medicines scientific research public health infrastructure pandemic preparedness and food and tobacco products hhs also manages governmentfunded health care for millions of americans including seniors disabled people and lowerincome patients who rely on medicare medicaid and the affordable care acts markets kennedy plans to create a new hhs agency called the administration for a healthy america which will combine several existing offices that includes hrsa samhsa the office of the assistant secretary for health the agency for toxic substances and disease registry and the national institute for occupational safety and health a leaked page preliminary budget document also indicates that the hhs office of minority health would fall under that new agency according to several reports but that proposal which would slash the hhs budget by a third or roughly billion requires congressional approval hhs did not immediately respond to a request for comment while the breadth of the cutbacks varied at agencies within hhs the minority health agencies across the departments will now be only a fraction of their former size all staff members at the cms office of minority health were laid off according to the people cms plans to appoint a new director for that unit but the current director has not resigned from the role cnbc previously the office works with local and federal partners to eliminate disparities in health coverage aiming to ensure that minority and underserved populations can access medicare medicaid and affordable care act marketplace plans it also conducts research and analysis to help lower costs and reduce the incidence and severity of chronic diseases in the us nearly all staff at the cdcs office of minority health were cut according to the people to adhere to the letter of the law the trump administration is considering reconstituting that unit and the office of womens health so that each office would be made up of at least one director or a very small group of employees the people said the agencys office of minority health works across cdc to promote research of health disparities and create programs to improve the health of racial and ethnic minority groups at the fdas office of minority health and health equity all staff were cut the people said the future of that office is unclear the unit focuses on efforts such as increasing clinical trial diversity improving transparency around how medical products affect different populations and creating health resources tailored to a range of languages and cultures no staff are left at hrsas office of health equity after the layoffs as well as some retirements and reassignments according to the people that office leads efforts to reduce disparities in healthcare access quality and outcomes through hrsa which focuses on people who are uninsured geographically isolated or economically and medically vulnerable the future of that office is also unclear apart from the trump administrations plans to fold hrsa into kennedys new agency the same goes for samhsas which saw all remaining staff cut except for a new recently hired director according to the people the office also had a retirement and one worker on probation who was put on administrative leave the office works to ensure that samhsas resources for mental health and substance abuse treatment including grant programs and other initiatives are equitably distributed across all communities and populations roughly a third of staff are gone at nimhd some of whom were laid off and others who left due to early retirements and buyouts the people said some workers on probation were put on leave several weeks before kennedy started cuts they said the institutes deputy director accepted an offer to be acting director in the short term the people added nimhd which is part of the national institutes of health works to reduce health disparities through conducting and funding research and developing new programs the hhs office of minority health also faced cuts though its unclear how many staff were impacted the people said that office leads the federal effort to improve health outcomes for racial and ethnic minority groups developing policies and programs and providing funding it will likely take several months to a year before the us sees direct consequences from the cuts to nimhd and the offices said terry mcgovern professor at the cuny graduate school of public health and health policy but the staff reductions could cause the us to lose out on crucial data which is the cornerstone for addressing health disparities according to samantha artiga director for the racial equity and health policy program at kff a health policy research organization artiga said data and research are essential for pinpointing where disparities exist understanding their root causes crafting effective solutions and tracking progress over time for example data can reveal whether certain groups experience worse surgical outcomes or wait longer at the emergency room or if a vaccination program is being equitably distributed across regions without focused data and research those disparities may remain unseen and unaddressed creating blind spots artiga said adding that the us would eventually have to rebuild that knowledge in the future the fate of many of the grants that nimhd and some of the offices provide is unclear that includes from hhs office of minority health to organizations for a fouryear initiative to identify strategies that increase the use of preventive health services in communities but if offices cut back that funding or stop it altogether it could also weaken the nations ability to reduce health disparities boston universitys ettinger de cuba said communitybased organizations rely on federal money to deliver culturally tailored care to different groups and could be forced to scale back or shut down programs the loss of grants could also stall research innovation and public health interventions by outside entities such as universities healthcare systems and social service organizations philanthropy is not able to step up at this level long term the only actor thats able to do that is the government ettinger de cuba said nathan boucher research professor at dukes sanford school of public policy added that the cuts will degrade any effort of these larger governmental organizations to have any accountability when it comes to protecting the people they help and serve every day while kennedy has said his cuts are focused on making hhs more responsive and efficient boucher said targeting minority health offices could do the opposite i actually think its an efficiency argument to be able to have these minority health offices because it allows you to identify and target some real problem areas and use taxpayer dollars in the most efficient way possible said boucher", "author": null, "publishedAt": "", "source": "", "url":

potential for macro headwinds we got smarter about the markets that we wanted and the lives that we wanted to compete for and so we actually have planned and budgeted for the elevated trends cvs ceo david joyner said in an interview with cnbc referring to markets that the insurance unit operates in and higher medical costs so i think why youre not seeing a surprise on our part is because we actually plan for elevated trends going into this year he added joyner said the company is watching for the potential impact from president s planned tariffs on pharmaceuticals imported into the us on the pharmacy side i think it is highly dependent on what happens in the next week or two when they announce the implications of tariffs on the manufacturers he told cnbc joyner added that the vast

return to hospitals for procedures they delayed during the pandemic but for the first time in several quarters cvs insurance business appeared to show some signs of improvement the units medical benefit ratio a measure of total medical expenses paid relative to premiums collected decreased to from a year earlier a lower ratio typically indicates that a company collected more in premiums than it paid out in benefits resulting in higher profitability cvs said the move partly reflects stronger underlying performance in its medicare business and improved medicare advantage star ratings for the payment year those ratings help patients compare the quality of medicare health and drug plans i think that investment and talent that allowed us to focus on both the execution and the operation

the results cap off the second full quarter with a longtime cvs executive as chief executive of the retail drugstore chain joyner succeeded karen lynch in midoctober as cvs struggled to drive higher

mecklenburg hinges executive chairman started the company in the pair met while they were both pursuing phds in the uk perez at the university of oxford and mecklenburg at imperial college london they were distracted students according to perezs twin brother david by the time they launched hinge perez and mecklenburg had already cofounded two other ventures together one was the oxbridge biotech roundtable an organization that connected academics and industry experts the other was marblar which worked to commercialize academic intellectual property perez took a leave of absence from oxford while working on marblar and never returned his brother wasnt a fan of the decision initially i gave him terrible advice said david perez a graduate of yale law school and partner at perkins coie in seattle i was like i think youre an idiot i think you should focus on your phd only an idiot would not finish a phd at oxford the twins have two older siblings their mother immigrated from cuba in followed years later by their father their parents met in miami got married after just three dates and are still together after more than years the family moved from miami to salt lake city utah in perezs mother was a substitute teacher and his father worked at restaurants as a dishwasher and busboy david perez said their father worked around the clock and used to call out orders in his sleep it wasnt a lot of money i think combined they made about a year david perez said but they stitched it together and raised four kids the twin boys were competitive particularly when it came to academics and playing basketball in the driveway david said his brother got great grades and always had an inclination toward science and medicine graduating from high school at age and then starting college at westminster university a small liberal arts school in utah i swear david perez said there were times where the only punishment that my mom could issue that would have the sting was restricting our ability to do homework perez was a student in the honors college at westminster and he graduated with a degree in biology richard badenhausen dean of the honors college described perez as an independent thinker and an ambitious student especially for his age he didnt care too much what people thought about him which is a strength in my book badenhausen said in an interview when perez was he was hit by a car he broke an arm and a leg and had to be airlifted to a nearby hospital after three surgeries and months of rehab he had a newfound interest in orthopedics and physical therapy mecklenburg had a serious injury of his own tearing his anterior cruciate ligament acl during a judo match which also required a year of rehab according to hinges website one day in october the pair put their heads together and outlined the tools they wished were available while undergoing physical therapy musculoskeletal conditions affect as many as billion people worldwide according to hinges prospectus so there was no shortage of opportunities they had the early concept of hinge within hours and a prototype ready by december of that year in hinges early days perez and mecklenburg would meet every saturday morning to talk shop now as theyve aged and started families they meet on wednesday nights according to colleagues perez welcomed his first child with his wife late last year seeing the growth over the last six seven eight years has just been unbelievable said jon reynolds a tech founder who contributed to hinges seed funding round that comes down to the quality of dan and gabriel as leaders they complement each other really well and theyve obviously got that mutual respect perez is a handson ceo who expects a lot from his staff hes direct detailoriented opinionated competitive and can be intense according to current and former employees but hes committed to the mission and the wellbeing of his employees they said hes one of those rare founder ceos who i think can go all the way said paul kruszewski a former hinge employee who joined the company after it acquired his canadian computer vision startup wrnch in employees say perez is a voracious reader often finishing two to four books a month that includes books about business and leadership an important source of information given that hinge was his first real job hes a fan of the innovators prescription by and others crossing the chasm by geoffrey moore and the long fix by dr vivian lee he also likes his staffers to read executives will often prepare to discuss chapters from a book in their meetings id come home and thered be a package from dan and its a book said sturm who led partnerships and new market development at hinge that was just the norm sturm who has worked in the healthcare and benefits space for around years said hinge was very deliberate with hiring so there wasnt a lot of turnover among senior executives he said hinges recruitment process was the hardest hes ever experienced another danism as sturm called it is hinges philosophy around writing perez has employees write memos typically up to six pages long instead of preparing slide decks or other materials ahead of meetings perez was inspired by a similar practice at according to current and former employees and sees it as a way to force employees to think through what they want to say instead of hiding behind bullet points hinges memo culture can be an adjustment particularly for new employees sturm said he thought the practice was insane at first but ultimately came to appreciate it and said it improved his pitches when you sort of sit back you go you know actually he wasnt wrong sturm said hinge has come a long way since venture firm atomico led the million series a investment in the londonbased firm said in a at the time that it was extremely impressed by daniel and gabriel and their determination to tackle a big problem in society carolina brochado led the round though she left atomico a year later and now works at investment firm eqt group she said that getting hinge to the brink of an ipo was a one in a million chance but noted that the company has managed to build a sizable business in digital health despite having so many odds stacked against it lots of learnings along the way of course like a big tech correction in the middle brochado said in an interview but it really is one of those rare examples of just an enormous market that was under penetrated for david perez whose firm now serves as hinges outside counsel watching the startup grow has been

that the guidance does not currently include any potential impact related to future tariffs and trade policy changes which we are unable to predict at this time but on the earnings call on tuesday

impacted by further tariffs in the future we will assess the impact of the policies enacted and provide information at the appropriate time bourla said he added that uncertainty around trumps

posted earnings per share of cents for the quarter pfizer reported revenue of billion for the first quarter down from the same period a year ago the company said the decrease in sales was primarily driven by a decline in revenue for paxlovid which posted million in sales during the first quarter down from the same period a year ago in part due to lower covid infections worldwide and reduced international government purchases of the drug the drop in sales also reflects a boost pfizer got in the first quarter of from a final adjustment related to a previously recorded revenue reversal for

{"title": "the outdated healthcare idea thats holding women back in life and careers", "description": "", "content": "twentyfive years ago joanna strober invested in a company called babycenter twentyfive years later the company is still serving women a lot of women strober says she was a pregnant venture investor at the time she made the babycenter investment and it helped to spark a bigger idea for too long she says the storyline for women facing challenges has been just deal with it its a weird thing and thats just really unhealthy and we have to change that strober said at the recent cnbc changemakers summit in los angeles for chelsea hirschhorn having her first child led her to become totally disillusioned with the chasm between the image of new parenthood that was marketed and the reality she experienced the pictureperfect image of parenting was overwhelming for a new parent she said there was a big dichotomy between the content i was consuming and the frontline experience at am hirschhorn says there was no data available at the time to substantiate what she felt because the topic was understudied and underfunded so she took on the category of infant health and wellness for whatever reason hirschhorn says she had the conviction to think i could fix this while there is a distinction between the health challenges the two female ceo and founders focus on not every woman will become pregnant but all will go through menopause one big idea binds the two women leaders together products treatments and services exist that can meet critical needs in an underserved and undervalued market we have this idea that perimenopause is at a certain time and people think they have to suffer for a really long time before they get the right care but what we say is you dont have to suffer at all strober shared at the changemakers summit as soon as youre in your s and anything starts feeling wrong you should get help the idea of suffering is really outdated she said women have been trained to suffer for far too long and were both named to the actress and entrepreneur who has become a leading advocate for menopause health as founder and chief creative officer at stripes beauty after struggling with early menopause at the height of her early hollywood fame was also among the changemakers at the changemakers summit on april the two women ceos shared advice and lessons from their successes bringing new business ideas to health care here are a few of the key themes they touched on in a discussion with cnbcs kate rooney in addition to the dearth of information that exists to prepare women for the reality of parenthood educational content for women has been censored when on topics related to reproductive health that was something that hirschhorn learned once she started frida a time when it was almost impossible she says to find authentic storytelling on the subject matter and led her to create sixty percent of womens health ads content or content in general has been in some way shape or form rejected or filtered she said thats not just online but on linear television part of what hirschhorn calls a very gendered dichotomy citing the fact that male health and sexual wellness content is approved at a significantly higher rate that leaves her incredulous she said and it is a call to action to shift from womens health being a topic of provocation to a topic of public health women have to advocate for themselves she said women cant be complacent and this goes beyond health care this can drive real change in retail in every facet of life she added strober noted that when she was building midi health it became clear that a major challenge would be working with codes created by the insurance industry for menopause in effect another form of institutional censorship midi health decided to position itself as an innetwork primary care provider that had a specialty in menopause and that turned out to be a really effective way to gain traction she says and it now has nationwide insurance coverage with all the large insurance companies in the us they are not necessarily going to cover sexual health issues but they will cover primary care so you just subsume it she explained by viewing menopause as just part of womens health she says the company was able to create a reimbursement mechanism that meets insurance standards that insurance coverage is a very big deal because research is showing that lack of menopause treatment can have a high cost when it comes to womens careers strober pointed to during the changemakers discussion found that at the midcareer moment when women should be gaining their greatest successes in the workplace the shift into menopause can hold them back strober said the growing body of research details how menopause can result in discrimination at work with women quitting jobs or not going for raises or promotions because of symptoms and also because they dont believe they can get the treatment that they need if you believe that you have something that cant be fixed its very embarrassing and that means people step back from what they are doing strober said they are scared she added that can be the experience that is called brain fog and also hot flashes you lose power during hot flashes strober said people are not as confident but if you are getting treated for it its just a hot flash and you can regain power she added hirschhorn says that by the numbers there is still huge potential in the womens health market it is estimated to grow to billion by according to data she cited at the event and that is despite the fact that less than of healthcare rd spending and investment goes to the category a seismic gap she said it is a wellknown fact in consumer research that women dominate household spending but hirschhorn said in fridas market there is a viral opportunity that is underappreciated creating products for women based on real need creates a virality that is hard to recreate with other demographics she said these women arent just buying their products they are selling them to their communities and friends we call that word of mom hirschhorn said its a really big untapped opportunity she added as a former venture investor strober said it is important to accept that people are not dying to invest in womens health but she added that when you can show the growth that companies like midi health are posting that wont slow a company down we are the fastestgrowing digital health company probably ever quite honestly she said we are growing insanely fast because women really need access to this care and cant get it elsewhere she added similar to the virality experienced by frida strober says the business model does build on itself once you take care of one thing for women they come back to you for something else and if you develop this trusted platform for them where they become your longterm patient that is a good business she said we dont say its a womens business we say its a really good business she added that opportunity and the unfiltered realities of parenthood have now grown frida to more than products covering everything from conception to postpartum and breastfeeding care and beyond my four children are a hotbed of inspiration and my snot sucking days are almost over hirschhorn said but she added the same problems exist you just need a different toolkit at midi health strober says the next big opportunity to unlock is making connections between menopause health and longevity if you take care of yourself in your s you can really prevent a lot of the diseases that come in your s and so we have been thinking a lot about this longevity market strober said its all bros all the bros who are out there and talking about wanting to live to we just want to take care of ourselves we dont care about living to we just want to be healthy grandmas she said what do we do how do we take care of our brains and bones and hearts to age in a healthy way strober asks she says there are many treatments products and services yet to be developed by health companies that will help women in their s s and s to better answer that

cuts to several divisions that help protect and improve the health of minority and underserved populations and eliminate health disparities in the us cnbc has learned kennedy the health and human services secretary has gutted at least seven minority health offices across the department according to people familiar with the matter who requested anonymity to speak freely hhs has laid off a significant share of workers at those offices or in some cases all of them along with their directors the people said the affected units include the hhs office of minority health and the national institute on minority health and health disparities or the cuts also hit offices with similar functions at the food and drug administration the centers for disease control and prevention the centers for medicare medicaid services the health resources and services administration and the substance abuse and mental health services administration according to the people health policy experts told cnbc that deep cuts to those divisions could widen existing health disparities in the us undoing years of progress toward addressing them over time that could worsen health outcomes for already underserved groups threaten overall public health strain the us healthcare system and drive up healthcare costs it will have negative health impacts obviously for groups that theyre focused on so racial and ethnic minorities but i think what gets missed in the story is it ultimately impacts all of us no matter what your background is dr stephanie ettinger de cuba research professor of health law policy and management at boston university told cnbc its not a zerosum game so i think thats what is deeply disturbing to me as we are going to see people get hurt she said decimating or cutting staff from these offices ultimately makes it worse for everyone the trump administration cant shutter the affected offices entirely which would since they were authorized by the affordable care act more than a decade ago the people said the exact fate of each office and the nih institute is unclear they added the administration likely hopes to at least narrow the scope of what nimhd and the agency offices do curtailing their authority and limiting resources said brandyn churchill professor of public administration and policy at american university the cuts come as health disparities remain a major challenge in the us affecting not only people of color but also rural residents lowincome communities and individuals with disabilities among several other groups these communities often face worse health outcomes such as lower life expectancy and higher rates of infant mortality and chronic disease and more limited access to care and other resources than the us population as a whole the covid pandemic deepened many of these gaps highlighting how the long us history of exclusionary policies and systemic issues such as poverty and racism contribute to unequal health outcomes across the country health policy experts stress that addressing those disparities leads to stronger overall public health as healthier communities improve outcomes for everyone it could also relieve a huge economic burden on the us a found that racial and ethnic health disparities cost the us economy billion in kennedy is consolidating divisions and slashing jobs at hhs that oversees vaccines and other medicines scientific research public health infrastructure pandemic preparedness and food and tobacco products hhs also manages governmentfunded health care for millions of americans including seniors disabled people and lowerincome patients who rely on medicare medicaid and the affordable care acts markets kennedy plans to create a new hhs agency called the administration for a healthy america which will combine several existing offices that includes hrsa samhsa the office of the assistant secretary for health the agency for toxic substances and disease registry and the national institute for occupational safety and health a leaked page preliminary budget document also indicates that the hhs office of minority health would fall under that new agency according to several reports but that proposal which would slash the hhs budget by a third or roughly billion requires congressional approval hhs did not immediately respond to a request for comment while the breadth of the cutbacks varied at agencies within hhs the minority health agencies across the departments will now be only a fraction of their former size all staff members at the cms office of minority health were laid off according to the people cms plans to appoint a new director for that unit but the current director has not resigned from the role cnbc previously the office works with local and federal partners to eliminate disparities in health coverage aiming to ensure that minority and underserved populations can access medicare medicaid and affordable care act marketplace plans it also conducts research and analysis to help lower costs and reduce the incidence and severity of chronic diseases in the us nearly all staff at the cdcs office of minority health were cut according to the people to adhere to the letter of the law the trump administration is considering reconstituting that unit and the office of womens health so that each office would be made up of at least one director or a very small group of employees the people said the agencys office of minority health works across cdc to promote research of health disparities and create programs to improve the health of racial and ethnic minority groups at the fdas office of minority health and health equity all staff were cut the people said the future of that office is unclear the unit focuses on efforts such as increasing clinical trial diversity improving transparency around how medical products affect different populations and creating health resources tailored to a range of languages and cultures no staff are left at hrsas office of health equity after the layoffs as well as some retirements and reassignments according to the people that office leads efforts to reduce disparities in healthcare access quality and outcomes through hrsa which focuses on people who are uninsured geographically isolated or economically and medically vulnerable the future of that office is also unclear apart from the trump administrations plans to fold hrsa into kennedys new agency the same goes for samhsas which saw all remaining staff cut except for a new recently hired director according to the people the office also had a retirement and one worker on probation who was put on administrative leave the office works to ensure that samhsas resources for mental health and substance abuse treatment including grant programs and other initiatives are equitably distributed across all communities and populations roughly a third of staff are gone at nimhd some of whom were laid off and others who left due to early retirements and buyouts the people said some workers on probation were put on leave several weeks before kennedy started cuts they said the institutes deputy director accepted an offer to be acting director in the short term the people added nimhd which is part of the national institutes of health works to reduce health disparities through conducting and funding research and developing new programs the hhs office of minority health also faced cuts though its unclear how many staff were impacted the people said that office leads the federal effort to improve health outcomes for racial and ethnic minority groups developing policies and programs and providing funding it will likely take several months to a year before the us sees direct consequences from the cuts to nimhd and the offices said terry mcgovern professor at the cuny graduate school of public health and health policy but the staff reductions could cause the us to lose out on crucial data which is the cornerstone for addressing health disparities according to samantha artiga director for the racial equity and health policy program at kff a health policy research organization artiga said data and research are essential for pinpointing where disparities exist understanding their root causes crafting effective solutions and tracking progress over time for example data can reveal whether certain groups experience worse surgical outcomes or wait longer at the emergency room or if a vaccination program is being equitably distributed across regions without focused data and research those disparities may remain unseen and unaddressed creating blind spots artiga said adding that the us would eventually have to rebuild that knowledge in the future the fate of many of the grants that nimhd and some of the offices provide is unclear that includes from hhs office of minority health to organizations for a fouryear initiative to identify strategies that increase the use of preventive health services in communities but if offices cut back that funding or stop it altogether it could also weaken the nations ability to reduce health disparities boston universitys ettinger de cuba said communitybased organizations rely on federal money to deliver culturally tailored care to different groups and could be forced to scale back or shut down programs the loss of grants could also stall research innovation and public health interventions by outside entities such as universities healthcare systems and social service organizations philanthropy is not able to step up at this level long term the only actor thats able to do that is the government ettinger de cuba said nathan boucher research professor at dukes sanford school of public policy added that the cuts will degrade any effort of these larger governmental organizations to have any accountability when it comes to protecting the people they help and serve every day while kennedy has said his cuts are focused on making hhs more responsive and efficient boucher said targeting minority health offices could do the opposite i actually think its an efficiency argument to be able to have these minority health offices because it allows you to identify and target some real problem areas and use taxpayer dollars in the most efficient way possible said boucher", "author": null, "publishedAt": "", "source": "", "url":

subsidiary omnicare a jury this week found omnicare liable for dispensing drugs without valid prescriptions to elderly and disabled individuals in assisted living and longterm care facilities cvs plans to appeal the company did not provide a revenue forecast for the year cvs said it is maintaining a cautious view for the remainder of the year in light of continued higher medical costs and the potential for macro headwinds we got smarter about the markets that we wanted and the lives that we wanted to compete for and so we actually have planned and budgeted for the elevated trends cvs ceo david joyner said in an interview with cnbc referring to markets that the insurance unit operates in and higher medical costs so i think why youre not seeing a surprise on our part is because we actually plan for elevated trends going into this year he added joyner said the company is watching for the potential impact from president s planned tariffs on pharmaceuticals imported into the us on the pharmacy side i think it is highly dependent on what happens in the next week or two when they announce the implications of tariffs on the manufacturers he told cnbc joyner added that the vast majority of the companys retail products at the front of stores are sourced in the us which should be a benefit for us heres what cvs reported for the first quarter compared with what wall street was expecting based on a survey of analysts by lseg the companys insurer aetna and its rivals have been dogged by higherthanexpected medical costs over the last year as more medicare advantage patients return to hospitals for procedures they delayed during the pandemic but for the first time in several quarters cvs insurance business appeared to show some signs of improvement the units medical benefit ratio a measure of total medical expenses paid relative to premiums collected decreased to from a year earlier a lower ratio typically indicates that a company collected more in premiums than it paid out in benefits resulting in higher profitability cvs said the move partly reflects stronger underlying performance in its medicare business and improved medicare advantage star ratings for the payment year those ratings help patients compare the quality of medicare health and drug plans i think that investment and talent that allowed us to focus on both the execution and the operation actually helped establish the performance that youre seeing joyner said referring to an executive reshuffling last year that tapped a new leader for the insurance unit and other parts of the business the results cap off the second full quarter with a longtime cvs executive as chief executive of the retail drugstore chain joyner succeeded karen lynch in midoctober as cvs struggled to drive higher profits and improve its stock performance the company underwent a management reshuffle as part of a broader turnaround plan that includes in cost cuts over the next several years still cvs performance was partially offset by a charge of million from socalled premium deficiency reserves in the insurance unit which is related to anticipated losses in the coverage year that refers to a liability that an insurer may need to cover if future premiums are not enough to pay for anticipated claims and expenses the company posted net income of billion or per share for the first quarter that compares with net income of billion or cents per share for the yearearlier period excluding certain items such as amortization of intangible assets restructuring charges and capital losses adjusted earnings were

roundtable an organization that connected academics and industry experts the other was marblar which worked to commercialize academic intellectual property perez took a leave of absence from oxford while working on marblar and never returned his brother wasnt a fan of the decision initially i gave him terrible advice said david perez a graduate of yale law school and partner at perkins coie in seattle i was like i think youre an idiot i think you should focus on your phd only an idiot would not finish a phd at oxford the twins have two older siblings their mother immigrated from cuba in followed years later by their father their parents met in miami got married after just three dates and are still together after more than years the family moved from miami to salt lake city utah in perezs mother was a substitute teacher and his father worked at restaurants as a dishwasher and busboy david perez said their father worked around the clock and used to call out orders in his sleep it wasnt a lot of money i think combined they made about a year david perez said but they stitched it together and raised four kids the twin boys were competitive particularly when it came to academics and playing basketball in the driveway david said his brother got great grades and always had an inclination toward science and medicine graduating from high school at age and then starting college at westminster university a small liberal arts school in utah i swear david perez said there were times where the only punishment that my mom could issue that would have the sting was restricting our ability to do homework perez was a student in the honors college at westminster and he graduated with a degree in biology richard badenhausen dean of the honors college described perez as an independent thinker and an ambitious student especially for his age he didnt care too much what people thought about him which is a strength in my book badenhausen said in an interview when perez was he was hit by a car he broke an arm and a leg and had to be airlifted to a nearby hospital after three surgeries and months of rehab he had a newfound interest in orthopedics and physical therapy mecklenburg had a serious injury of his own tearing his anterior cruciate ligament acl during a judo match which also required a year of rehab according to hinges website one day in october the pair put their heads together and outlined the tools they wished were available while undergoing physical therapy musculoskeletal conditions affect as many as billion people worldwide according to hinges prospectus so there was no shortage of opportunities they had the early concept of hinge within hours and a prototype ready by december of that year in hinges early days perez and mecklenburg would meet every saturday morning to talk shop now as theyve aged and started families they meet on wednesday nights according to colleagues perez welcomed his first child with his wife late last year seeing the growth over the last six seven eight years has just been unbelievable said jon reynolds a tech founder who contributed to hinges seed funding round that comes down to the quality of dan and gabriel as leaders they complement each other really well and theyve obviously got that mutual respect perez is a handson ceo who expects a lot from his staff hes direct detailoriented opinionated competitive and can be intense according to current and former employees but hes committed to the mission and the wellbeing of his employees they said hes one of those rare founder ceos who i think can go all the way said paul kruszewski a former hinge employee who joined the company after it acquired his canadian computer vision startup wrnch in employees say perez is a voracious reader often finishing two to four books a month that includes books about business and leadership an important source of information given that hinge was his first real job hes a fan of the innovators prescription by and others crossing the chasm by geoffrey moore and the long fix by dr vivian lee he also likes his staffers to read executives will often prepare to discuss chapters from a book in their meetings id come home and thered be a package from dan and its a book said sturm who led partnerships and new market development at hinge that was just the norm sturm who has worked in the healthcare and benefits space for around years said hinge was very deliberate with hiring so there wasnt a lot of turnover among senior executives he said hinges recruitment process was the hardest hes ever experienced another danism as sturm called it is hinges philosophy around writing perez has employees write memos typically up to six pages long instead of preparing slide decks or other materials ahead of meetings perez was inspired by a similar practice at according to current and former employees and sees it as a way to force employees to think through what they want to say instead of hiding behind bullet points hinges memo culture can be an adjustment particularly for new employees sturm said he thought the practice was insane at first but ultimately came to appreciate it and said it improved his pitches when you sort of sit back you go you know actually he wasnt wrong sturm said hinge has come a long way since venture firm atomico led the million series a investment in the londonbased firm said in a at the time that it was extremely impressed by daniel and gabriel and their determination to tackle a big problem in society carolina brochado led the round though she left atomico a year later and now works at investment firm eqt group she said that getting hinge to the brink of an ipo was a one in a million chance but noted that the company has managed to build a sizable business in digital health despite having so many odds stacked against it lots of learnings along the way of course like a big tech correction in the middle brochado said in an interview but it really is one of those rare examples of just an enormous market that was under penetrated for david perez whose firm now serves as hinges outside counsel watching the startup grow has been fascinating he said im a partner at a major law firm he said and i am only the second most successful twin but i think im okay with that", "author": null, "publishedAt": "", "source": "", "url":

grip on the booming weight loss market heres a recap of what sparked the panic on thursday if you missed it s pharmacy benefit manager caremark said it s wegovy on its standard formularies on july making that weekly injection the preferred glp drug for obesity as part of the move caremark will also drop eli lillys weight loss drug zepbound from those formularies which represent tens of millions of patients caremark negotiated an undisclosed lower net price for wegovy over zepbound on its standard formularies offering savings on novo nordisks drug to clients that opt into those plans but employers and unions will ultimately determine how much of those savings on wegovy get shared with members cvs said wegovys list price before insurance is for a months supply while zepbounds is that decision by one of the nations largest pbms triggered fears of a price war in the weight loss drug market and concerns that zepbounds sales momentum could stall shares of eli lilly plunged on thursday but several wall street analysts said the selloff was overblown in our view the novocvs deal does not represent the beginning of an obesity pricing war between lilly novo bmo capital markets analyst evan seigerman said in a note on thursday he added that in discussions with the companies both lilly and novo emphasized they want to expand patient access not undercut each other on price that may be reassuring to investors worried that a price war could hurt profit margins but the high list price of those weight loss drugs may remain a major barrier for many patients particularly those whose health plans dont cover the medications eli lilly told the firm it is not interested in exclusive oneofone deals with pbms while novo nordisk said cvs approached the drugmaker about the wegovy agreement according to seigerman on an earnings call on thursday eli lilly ceo david ricks said the company has been trying to move away from setting high list prices and paying bigger rebates to pbms for preferential coverage instead eli lilly is trying to set list prices closer to what it expects the plans to pay for its drugs we have been very vocal about trying to move away from that ricks said referring to deep pbm rebates he added that zepbound is still growing market share seigerman agreed saying that eli lilly is continuing to perform where it matters zepbound and the companys diabetes drug mounjaro now make up over half of us glp prescriptions outpacing the combined share of novo nordisks wegovy and its diabetes treatment ozempic according to seigerman that marketshare traction clearly demonstrates that physicians and patients prefer zepbound over wegovy bernstein analyst courtney breen wrote in a separate note on thursday its unclear how much the cvs formulary change will appeal to employers especially given that zepbound is known to be more effective at promoting weight loss than wegovy some patients on the standard formularies may also try to stay on their current zepbound prescriptions by requesting exemptions jpmorgan analyst chris schott said in a thursday note eli lillys ricks also said cvs move mainly affects smaller employers who are more likely to stick with caremarks standard formularies larger companies covering more patients often use customized formularies meaning they can still decide to include zepbound regardless the cvswegovy deal overshadowed for eli lilly the companys firstquarter revenue and earnings topped estimates on skyrocketing demand for zepbound and mounjaro both of which raked in billions of dollars in sales for the

and additional inapp health insights both of the companys new devices are designed for wear the whoop and whoop mg support days of battery life which is around triple the fourtofiveday range offered by whoop the new hardware is also smaller than the previous device with a processor thats faster the company said weve taken everything weve learned over the past decade and built a platform to help our members perform and live at their peak for longer whoop founder and ceo said in a release the launch marks whoops first major hardware update since when the company released whoop whoop said its new devices will help users understand how their daily decisions impact their performance and outcomes over time according to a release there are three annual membership tiers whoop one which costs and includes the whoop whoop peak which costs and includes the whoop and whoop life which costs and includes the whoop mg accessories like additional bands will come at an extra cost whoop and whoop mg memberships and accessories are available for purchase online starting on thursday whoop one members will be able to use their whoop to measure sleep strain and recovery as well as the cardiovascular and muscular impact of various workouts users can also track their menstrual cycles and pregnancies whoop peak builds on those core metrics members have access to a health monitor feature which provides a quick look at vitals like respiratory rate heart rate blood oxygen and skin temperature whoop peak also supports a realtime stress monitor where users can see their stress level and complete guided breathing sessions if theyd like to increase relaxation or alertness the company also unveiled a feature called healthspan which uses nine metrics to calculate adult users whoop age and pace of aging a users whoop age compares their physiological age to their actual age and pace of aging assesses how fast or slow someone is aging based on their behavior the healthspan feature is updated every week and users will get tips about how they can improve their whoop age and pace of aging in their app whoop developed this feature in partnership with the buck institute for research on aging the company said the most comprehensive membership is whoop life which will give users access to additional medicalgrade health features with whoop mg whoop life members can record an electrocardiogram or an ecg to detect irregular heart rhythms like afib high heart rate or low heart rate once the reading is complete they can share a pdf of the recording with their doctor the ecg feature has been cleared by the us food and drug administration its not intended for users under years old or for users with a cardiac pacemaker or other implanted devices it will be available in the us the uae and qatar at launch with additional countries coming soon whoop life members can also get daily insights about their blood pressure including estimated systolic and diastolic ranges users will have to log a traditional cuffreading to act as a baseline to unlock this feature and its not intended for treatment diagnosis or medical use whoop said blood pressure insights has been in development for several years and the feature is currently in beta i got a sneak peek at the whoop mg and ive been wearing it for the past few days i cant speak to what its like to wear the device over an extended period but my initial experience has been largely positive from a hardware standpoint the whoop mg looks and feels sleeker than the whoop which i tested out in april the actual sensor is roughly an inch wide and the band is slightly thinner than that ive found that both the whoop mg and the whoop are a little hard to take off you really have to tug on the latch the whoop mgs setup is very straightforward and i was up and running on the app in a matter of minutes with all the new features theres a lot of additional data to make sense of so the app seemed pretty busy to me at first i felt like i had a better handle on it after a few hours though and i havent felt pressure to constantly monitor it of the new features i thought healthspan was particularly interesting as a relatively healthy yearold i noticed i still felt relieved to be younger than my age id be curious to see how that feature would change based on my behaviors from week to week i also liked the whoop mgs detailed sleep tracking and the realtime stress monitor as stress is something ive personally been trying to be more mindful of ive learned that my stress levels really skyrocket while im taking public transport for instance and adjust accordingly after about a dozen tries i wasnt able to log a successful ecg reading i kept getting errors even after switching wrists and the positioning of my arms thats been disappointing as im interested to see my results the blood pressure insights are neat and assuming other users can successfully record ecg readings its easy to see the potential benefit that said i dont think i need those features in my daily life yet so the whoop life membership probably wouldnt be the right pick for me im not totally sold on the whoop mgs aesthetics i have small hands and wrists so i always feel like smart devices tend to look clunky on me i definitely felt like the whoop was too big for me but the whoop mg doesnt bother me quite as much thats just my personal taste and there are lots of whoop accessories you can buy to spiff up the device for different occasions after just a few days theres a lot i can still learn from the whoop mg but i feel like id personally reach for the whoop the range of membership options helps ensure that users dont have to break the bank so id feel comfortable recommending whoop and whoop mg to my friends and family

{"title": "the outdated healthcare idea thats holding women back in life and careers", "description": "", "content": "twentyfive years ago joanna strober invested in a company called babycenter twentyfive years later the company is still serving women a lot of women strober says she was a pregnant venture investor at the time she made the babycenter investment and it helped to spark a bigger idea for too long she says the storyline for women facing challenges has been just deal with it its a weird thing and thats just really unhealthy and we have to change that strober said at the recent cnbc changemakers summit in los angeles for chelsea hirschhorn having her first child led her to become totally disillusioned with the chasm between the image of new parenthood that was marketed and the reality she experienced the pictureperfect image of parenting was overwhelming for a new parent she said there was a big dichotomy between the content i was consuming and the frontline experience at am hirschhorn says there was no data available at the time to substantiate what she felt because the topic was understudied and underfunded so she took on the category of infant health and wellness for whatever reason hirschhorn says she had the conviction to think i could fix this while there is a distinction between the health challenges the two female ceo and founders focus on not every woman will become pregnant but all will go through menopause one big idea binds the two women leaders together products treatments and services exist that can meet critical needs in an underserved and undervalued market we have this idea that perimenopause is at a certain time and people think they have to suffer for a really long time before they get the right care but what we say is you dont have to suffer at all strober shared at the changemakers summit as soon as youre in your s and anything starts feeling wrong you should get help the idea of suffering is really outdated she said women have been trained to suffer for far too long and were both named to the actress and entrepreneur who has become a leading advocate for menopause health as founder and chief creative officer at stripes beauty after struggling with early menopause at the height of her early hollywood fame was also among the changemakers at the changemakers summit on april the two women ceos shared advice and lessons from their successes bringing new business ideas to health care here are a few of the key themes they touched on in a discussion with cnbcs kate rooney in addition to the dearth of information that exists to prepare women for the reality of parenthood educational content for women has been censored when on topics related to reproductive health that was something that hirschhorn learned once she started frida a time when it was almost impossible she says to find authentic storytelling on the subject matter and led her to create sixty percent of womens health ads content or content in general has been in some way shape or form rejected or filtered she said thats not just online but on linear television part of what hirschhorn calls a very gendered dichotomy citing the fact that male health and sexual wellness content is approved at a significantly higher rate that leaves her incredulous she said and it is a call to action to shift from womens health being a topic of provocation to a topic of public health women have to advocate for themselves she said women cant be complacent and this goes beyond health care this can drive real change in retail in every facet of life she added strober noted that when she was building midi health it became clear that a major challenge would be working with codes created by the insurance industry for menopause in effect another form of institutional censorship midi health decided to position itself as an innetwork primary care provider that had a specialty in menopause and that turned out to be a really effective way to gain traction she says and it now has nationwide insurance coverage with all the large insurance companies in the us they are not necessarily going to cover sexual health issues but they will cover primary care so you just subsume it she explained by viewing menopause as just part of womens health she says the company was able to create a reimbursement mechanism that meets insurance standards that insurance coverage is a very big deal because research is showing that lack of menopause treatment can have a high cost when it comes to womens careers strober pointed to during the changemakers discussion found that at the midcareer moment when women should be gaining their greatest successes in the workplace the shift into menopause can hold them back strober said the growing body of research details how menopause can result in discrimination at work with women quitting jobs or not going for raises or promotions because of symptoms and also because they dont believe they can get the treatment that they need if you believe that you have something that cant be fixed its very embarrassing and that means people step back from what they are doing strober said they are scared she added that can be the experience that is called brain fog and also hot flashes you lose power during hot flashes strober said people are not as confident but if you are getting treated for it its just a hot flash and you can regain power she added hirschhorn says that by the numbers there is still huge potential in the womens health market it is estimated to grow to billion by according to data she cited at the event and that is despite the fact that less than of healthcare rd spending and investment goes to the category a seismic gap she said it is a wellknown fact in consumer research that women dominate household spending but hirschhorn said in fridas market there is a viral opportunity that is underappreciated creating products for women based on real need creates a virality that is hard to recreate with other demographics she said these women arent just buying their products they are selling them to their communities and friends we call that word of mom hirschhorn said its a really big untapped opportunity she added as a former venture investor strober said it is important to accept that people are not dying to invest in womens health but she added that when you can show the growth that companies like midi health are posting that wont slow a company down we are the fastestgrowing digital health company probably ever quite honestly she said we are growing insanely fast because women really need access to this care and cant get it elsewhere she added similar to the virality experienced by frida strober says the business model does build on itself once you take care of one thing for women they come back to you for something else and if you develop this trusted platform for them where they become your longterm patient that is a good business she said we dont say its a womens business we say its a really good business she added that opportunity and the unfiltered realities of parenthood have now grown frida to more than products covering everything from conception to postpartum and breastfeeding care and beyond my four children are a hotbed of inspiration and my snot sucking days are almost over hirschhorn said but she added the same problems exist you just need a different toolkit at midi health strober says the next big opportunity to unlock is making connections between menopause health and longevity if you take care of yourself in your s you can really prevent a lot of the diseases that come in your s and so we have been thinking a lot about this longevity market strober said its all bros all the bros who are out there and talking about wanting to live to we just want to take care of ourselves we dont care about living to we just want to be healthy grandmas she said what do we do how do we take care of our brains and bones and hearts to age in a healthy way strober asks she says there are many treatments products and services yet to be developed by health companies that will help women in their s s and s to better answer that

{"title": "rfk jr is gutting hhs offices that are key to reducing health disparities", "description": "", "content": "robert f kennedy jrs of the department of health and human services involves deep cuts to several divisions that help protect and improve the health of minority and underserved populations and eliminate health disparities in the us cnbc has learned kennedy the health and human services secretary has gutted at least seven minority health offices across the department according to people familiar with the matter who requested anonymity to speak freely hhs has laid off a significant share of workers at those offices or in some cases all of them along with their directors the people said the affected units include the hhs office of minority health and the national institute on minority health and health disparities or the cuts also hit offices with similar functions at the food and drug administration the centers for disease control and prevention the centers for medicare medicaid services the health resources and services administration and the substance abuse and mental health services administration according to the people health policy experts told cnbc that deep cuts to those divisions could widen existing health disparities in the us undoing years of progress toward addressing them over time that could worsen health outcomes for already underserved groups threaten overall public health strain the us healthcare system and drive up healthcare costs it will have negative health impacts obviously for groups that theyre focused on so racial and ethnic minorities but i think what gets missed in the story is it ultimately impacts all of us no matter what your background is dr stephanie ettinger de cuba research professor of health law policy and management at boston university told cnbc its not a zerosum game so i think thats what is deeply disturbing to me as we are going to see people get hurt she said decimating or cutting staff from these offices ultimately makes it worse for everyone the trump administration cant shutter the affected offices entirely which would since they were authorized by the affordable care act more than a decade ago the people said the exact fate of each office and the nih institute is unclear they added the administration likely hopes to at least narrow the scope of what nimhd and the agency offices do curtailing their authority and limiting resources said brandyn churchill professor of public administration and policy at american university the cuts come as health disparities remain a major challenge in the us affecting not only people of color but also rural residents lowincome communities and individuals with disabilities among several other groups these communities often face worse health outcomes such as lower life expectancy and higher rates of infant mortality and chronic disease and more limited access to care and other resources than the us population as a whole the covid pandemic deepened many of these gaps highlighting how the long us history of exclusionary policies and systemic issues such as poverty and racism contribute to unequal health outcomes across the country health policy experts stress that addressing those disparities leads to stronger overall public health as healthier communities improve outcomes for everyone it could also relieve a huge economic burden on the us a found that racial and ethnic health disparities cost the us economy billion in kennedy is consolidating divisions and slashing jobs at hhs that oversees vaccines and other medicines scientific research public health infrastructure pandemic preparedness and food and tobacco products hhs also manages governmentfunded health care for millions of americans including seniors disabled people and lowerincome patients who rely on medicare medicaid and the affordable care acts markets kennedy plans to create a new hhs agency called the administration for a healthy america which will combine several existing offices that includes hrsa samhsa the office of the assistant secretary for health the agency for toxic substances and disease registry and the national institute for occupational safety and health a leaked page preliminary budget document also indicates that the hhs office of minority health would fall under that new agency according to several reports but that proposal which would slash the hhs budget by a third or roughly billion requires congressional approval hhs did not immediately respond to a request for comment while the breadth of the cutbacks varied at agencies within hhs the minority health agencies across the departments will now be only a fraction of their former size all staff members at the cms office of minority health were laid off according to the people cms plans to appoint a new director for that unit but the current director has not resigned from the role cnbc previously the office works with local and federal partners to eliminate disparities in health coverage aiming to ensure that minority and underserved populations can access medicare medicaid and affordable care act marketplace plans it also conducts research and analysis to help lower costs and reduce the incidence and severity of chronic diseases in the us nearly all staff at the cdcs office of minority health were cut according to the people to adhere to the letter of the law the trump administration is considering reconstituting that unit and the office of womens health so that each office would be made up of at least one director or a very small group of employees the people said the agencys office of minority health works across cdc to promote research of health disparities and create programs to improve the health of racial and ethnic minority groups at the fdas office of minority health and health equity all staff were cut the people said the future of that office is unclear the unit focuses on efforts such as increasing clinical trial diversity improving transparency around how medical products affect different populations and creating health resources tailored to a range of languages and cultures no staff are left at hrsas office of health equity after the layoffs as well as some retirements and reassignments according to the people that office leads efforts to reduce disparities in healthcare access quality and outcomes through hrsa which focuses on people who are uninsured geographically isolated or economically and medically vulnerable the future of that office is also unclear apart from the trump administrations plans to fold hrsa into kennedys new agency the same goes for samhsas which saw all remaining staff cut except for a new recently hired director according to the people the office also had a retirement and one worker on probation who was put on administrative leave the office works to ensure that samhsas resources for mental health and substance abuse treatment including grant programs and other initiatives are equitably distributed across all communities and populations roughly a third of staff are gone at nimhd some of whom were laid off and others who left due to early retirements and buyouts the people said some workers on probation were put on leave several weeks before kennedy started cuts they said the institutes deputy director accepted an offer to be acting director in the short term the people added nimhd which is part of the national institutes of health works to reduce health disparities through conducting and funding research and developing new programs the hhs office of minority health also faced cuts though its unclear how many staff were impacted the people said that office leads the federal effort to improve health outcomes for racial and ethnic minority groups developing policies and programs and providing funding it will likely take several months to a year before the us sees direct consequences from the cuts to nimhd and the offices said terry mcgovern professor at the cuny graduate school of public health and health policy but the staff reductions could cause the us to lose out on crucial data which is the cornerstone for addressing health disparities according to samantha artiga director for the racial equity and health policy program at kff a health policy research organization artiga said data and research are essential for pinpointing where disparities exist understanding their root causes crafting effective solutions and tracking progress over time for example data can reveal whether certain groups experience worse surgical outcomes or wait longer at the emergency room or if a vaccination program is being equitably distributed across regions without focused data and research those disparities may remain unseen and unaddressed creating blind spots artiga said adding that the us would eventually have to rebuild that knowledge in the future the fate of many of the grants that nimhd and some of the offices provide is unclear that includes from hhs office of minority health to organizations for a fouryear initiative to identify strategies that increase the use of preventive health services in communities but if offices cut back that funding or stop it altogether it could also weaken the nations ability to reduce health disparities boston universitys ettinger de cuba said communitybased organizations rely on federal money to deliver culturally tailored care to different groups and could be forced to scale back or shut down programs the loss of grants could also stall research innovation and public health interventions by outside entities such as universities healthcare systems and social service organizations philanthropy is not able to step up at this level long term the only actor thats able to do that is the government ettinger de cuba said nathan boucher research professor at dukes sanford school of public policy added that the cuts will degrade any effort of these larger governmental organizations to have any accountability when it comes to protecting the people they help and serve every day while kennedy has said his cuts are focused on making hhs more responsive and efficient boucher said targeting minority health offices could do the opposite i actually think its an efficiency argument to be able to have these minority health offices because it allows you to identify and target some real problem areas and use taxpayer dollars in the most efficient way possible said boucher", "author": null, "publishedAt": "", "source": "", "url":

subsidiary omnicare a jury this week found omnicare liable for dispensing drugs without valid prescriptions to elderly and disabled individuals in assisted living and longterm care facilities cvs plans to appeal the company did not provide a revenue forecast for the year cvs said it is maintaining a cautious view for the remainder of the year in light of continued higher medical costs and the potential for macro headwinds we got smarter about the markets that we wanted and the lives that we wanted to compete for and so we actually have planned and budgeted for the elevated trends cvs ceo david joyner said in an interview with cnbc referring to markets that the insurance unit operates in and higher medical costs so i think why youre not seeing a surprise on our part is because we actually plan for elevated trends going into this year he added joyner said the company is watching for the potential impact from president s planned tariffs on pharmaceuticals imported into the us on the pharmacy side i think it is highly dependent on what happens in the next week or two when they announce the implications of tariffs on the manufacturers he told cnbc joyner added that the vast

return to hospitals for procedures they delayed during the pandemic but for the first time in several quarters cvs insurance business appeared to show some signs of improvement the units medical benefit ratio a measure of total medical expenses paid relative to premiums collected decreased to from a year earlier a lower ratio typically indicates that a company collected more in premiums than it paid out in benefits resulting in higher profitability cvs said the move partly reflects stronger underlying performance in its medicare business and improved medicare advantage star ratings for the payment year those ratings help patients compare the quality of medicare health and drug plans i think that investment and talent that allowed us to focus on both the execution and the operation actually helped establish the performance that youre seeing joyner said referring to an executive reshuffling last year that tapped a new leader for the insurance unit and other parts of the business the results cap off the second full quarter with a longtime cvs executive as chief executive of the retail drugstore chain joyner succeeded karen lynch in midoctober as cvs struggled to drive higher

an insurer may need to cover if future premiums are not enough to pay for anticipated claims and expenses the company posted net income of billion or per share for the first quarter that compares with

mecklenburg hinges executive chairman started the company in the pair met while they were both pursuing phds in the uk perez at the university of oxford and mecklenburg at imperial college london they were distracted students according to perezs twin brother david by the time they launched hinge perez and mecklenburg had already cofounded two other ventures together one was the oxbridge biotech roundtable an organization that connected academics and industry experts the other was marblar which worked to commercialize academic intellectual property perez took a leave of absence from oxford while working on marblar and never returned his brother wasnt a fan of the decision initially i gave him terrible advice said david perez a graduate of yale law school and partner at perkins coie in seattle i was like i think youre an idiot i think you should focus on your phd only an idiot would not finish a phd at oxford the twins have two older siblings their mother immigrated from cuba in followed years later by their father their parents met in miami got married after just three dates and are still together after more than years the family moved from miami to salt lake city utah in perezs mother was a substitute teacher and his father worked at restaurants as a dishwasher and busboy david perez said their father worked around the clock and used to call out orders in his sleep it wasnt a lot of money i think combined they made about a year david perez said but they stitched it together and raised four kids the twin boys were competitive particularly when it came to academics and playing basketball in the driveway david said his brother got great grades and always had an inclination toward science and medicine graduating from high school at age and then starting college at westminster university a small liberal arts school in utah i swear david perez said there were times where the only punishment that my mom could issue that would have the sting was restricting our ability to do homework perez was a student in the honors college at westminster and he graduated with a degree in biology richard badenhausen dean of the honors college described perez as an independent thinker and an ambitious student especially for his age he didnt care too much what people thought about him which is a strength in my book badenhausen said in an interview when perez was he was hit by a car he broke an arm and a leg and had to be airlifted to a nearby hospital after three surgeries and months of rehab he had a newfound interest in orthopedics and physical therapy mecklenburg had a serious injury of his own tearing his anterior cruciate ligament acl during a judo match which also required a year of rehab according to hinges website one day in october the pair put their heads together and outlined the tools they wished were available while undergoing physical therapy musculoskeletal conditions affect as many as billion people worldwide according to hinges prospectus so there was no shortage of opportunities they had the early concept of hinge within hours and a prototype ready by december of that year in hinges early days perez and mecklenburg would meet every saturday morning to talk shop now as theyve aged and started families they meet on wednesday nights according to colleagues perez welcomed his first child with his wife late last year seeing the growth over the last six seven eight years has just been unbelievable said jon reynolds a tech founder who contributed to hinges seed funding round that comes down to the quality of dan and gabriel as leaders they complement each other really well and theyve obviously got that mutual respect perez is a handson ceo who expects a lot from his staff hes direct detailoriented opinionated competitive and can be intense according to current and former employees but hes committed to the mission and the wellbeing of his employees they said hes one of those rare founder ceos who i think can go all the way said paul kruszewski a former hinge employee who joined the company after it acquired his canadian computer vision startup wrnch in employees say perez is a voracious reader often finishing two to four books a month that includes books about business and leadership an important source of information given that hinge was his first real job hes a fan of the innovators prescription by and others crossing the chasm by geoffrey moore and the long fix by dr vivian lee he also likes his staffers to read executives will often prepare to discuss chapters from a book in their meetings id come home and thered be a package from dan and its a book said sturm who led partnerships and new market development at hinge that was just the norm sturm who has worked in the healthcare and benefits space for around years said hinge was very deliberate with hiring so there wasnt a lot of turnover among senior executives he said hinges recruitment process was the hardest hes ever experienced another danism as sturm called it is hinges philosophy around writing perez has employees write memos typically up to six pages long instead of preparing slide decks or other materials ahead of meetings perez was inspired by a similar practice at according to current and former employees and sees it as a way to force employees to think through what they want to say instead of hiding behind bullet points hinges memo culture can be an adjustment particularly for new employees sturm said he thought the practice was insane at first but ultimately came to appreciate it and said it improved his pitches when you sort of sit back you go you know actually he wasnt wrong sturm said hinge has come a long way since venture firm atomico led the million series a investment in the londonbased firm said in a at the time that it was extremely impressed by daniel and gabriel and their determination to tackle a big problem in society carolina brochado led the round though she left atomico a year later and now works at investment firm eqt group she said that getting hinge to the brink of an ipo was a one in a million chance but noted that the company has managed to build a sizable business in digital health despite having so many odds stacked against it lots of learnings along the way of course like a big tech correction in the middle brochado said in an interview but it really is one of those rare examples of just an enormous market that was under penetrated for david perez whose firm now serves as hinges outside counsel watching the startup grow has been fascinating he said im a partner at a major law firm he said and i am only the second most successful twin but i think im okay with that", "author": null, "publishedAt": "", "source": "", "url":

of patients caremark negotiated an undisclosed lower net price for wegovy over zepbound on its standard formularies offering savings on novo nordisks drug to clients that opt into those plans but employers and unions will ultimately determine how much of those savings on wegovy get shared with members cvs said wegovys list price before insurance is for a months supply while zepbounds is that decision by one of the nations largest pbms triggered fears of a price war in the weight loss drug market and concerns that zepbounds sales momentum could stall shares of eli lilly plunged on thursday but several wall street analysts said the selloff was overblown in our view the novocvs deal does not represent the beginning of an obesity pricing war between lilly novo bmo capital markets analyst evan seigerman said in a note on thursday he added that in discussions with the companies both lilly and novo emphasized they want to expand patient access not undercut each other on price that may be reassuring to investors worried that a price war could hurt profit margins but the high list price of those weight loss drugs may remain a major barrier for many patients particularly those whose health plans dont cover the medications eli lilly told the firm it is not interested in exclusive oneofone deals with pbms while novo nordisk said cvs approached the drugmaker about the wegovy agreement according to seigerman on an earnings call on thursday eli lilly ceo david ricks said the company has been trying to move away from setting high list prices and paying bigger rebates to pbms for preferential coverage instead eli lilly is trying to set list prices closer to what it expects the plans to pay for its drugs we have been very vocal about trying to move away from that ricks said referring to deep pbm rebates he added that zepbound is still growing market share seigerman agreed saying that eli lilly is continuing to perform where it matters zepbound and the companys diabetes drug mounjaro now make up over half of us glp prescriptions outpacing the combined share of novo nordisks wegovy and its diabetes treatment ozempic according to seigerman that marketshare traction clearly demonstrates that physicians and patients prefer zepbound over wegovy bernstein analyst courtney breen wrote in a separate note on thursday its unclear how much the cvs formulary change will appeal to employers especially given that zepbound is known to be more effective at promoting weight loss than wegovy some patients on the standard formularies may also try to stay on their current zepbound prescriptions by requesting exemptions jpmorgan analyst chris schott said in a thursday note eli lillys ricks also said cvs move mainly affects smaller employers who are more likely to stick with caremarks standard formularies larger companies covering more patients often use customized formularies meaning they can still decide to include zepbound regardless the cvswegovy deal

and additional inapp health insights both of the companys new devices are designed for wear the whoop and whoop mg support days of battery life which is around triple the fourtofiveday range offered by whoop the new hardware is also smaller than the previous device with a processor thats faster the company said weve taken everything weve learned over the past decade and built a platform to help our members perform and live at their peak for longer whoop founder and ceo said in a release the launch marks whoops first major hardware update since when the company released whoop whoop said its new devices will help users understand how their daily decisions impact their performance and outcomes over time according to a release there are three annual membership tiers whoop one which costs and includes the whoop whoop peak which costs and includes the whoop and whoop life which costs and includes the whoop mg accessories like additional bands will come at an extra cost whoop and whoop mg memberships and accessories are available for purchase online starting on thursday whoop one members will be able to use their whoop to measure sleep strain and recovery as well as the cardiovascular and muscular impact of various workouts users can also track their menstrual cycles and pregnancies whoop peak builds on those core metrics members have access to a health monitor feature which provides a quick look at vitals like respiratory rate heart rate blood oxygen and skin temperature whoop peak also supports a realtime stress monitor where users can see their stress level and complete guided breathing sessions if theyd like to increase relaxation or alertness the company also unveiled a feature called healthspan which uses nine metrics to calculate adult users whoop age and pace of aging a users whoop age compares their physiological age to their actual age and pace of aging assesses how fast or slow someone is aging based on their behavior the healthspan feature is updated every week and users will get tips about how they can improve their whoop age and pace of aging in their app whoop developed this feature in partnership with the buck institute for research on aging the company said the most comprehensive membership is whoop life which will give users access to additional medicalgrade health features with whoop mg whoop life members can record an electrocardiogram or an ecg to detect irregular heart rhythms like afib high heart rate or low heart rate once the reading is complete they can share a pdf of the recording with their doctor the ecg feature has been cleared by the us food and drug administration its not intended for users under years old or for users with a cardiac pacemaker or other implanted devices it will be available in the us the uae and qatar at launch with additional countries coming soon whoop life members can also get daily insights about their blood pressure including estimated systolic and diastolic ranges users will have to log a traditional cuffreading to act as a baseline to unlock this feature and its not intended for treatment diagnosis or medical use whoop said blood pressure insights has been in development for several years and the feature is currently in beta i got a sneak peek at the whoop mg and ive been wearing it for the past few days i cant speak to what its like to wear the device over an extended period but my initial experience has been largely positive from a hardware standpoint the whoop mg looks and feels sleeker than the whoop which i tested out in april the actual sensor is roughly an inch wide and the band is slightly thinner than that ive found that both the whoop mg and the whoop are a little hard to take off you really have to tug on the latch the whoop mgs setup is very straightforward and i was up and running on the app in a matter of minutes with all the new features theres a lot of additional data to make sense of so the app seemed pretty busy to me at first i felt like i had a better handle on it after a few hours though and i havent felt pressure to constantly monitor it of the new features i thought healthspan was particularly interesting as a relatively healthy yearold i noticed i still felt relieved to be younger than my age id be curious to see how that feature would change based on my behaviors from week to week i also liked the whoop mgs detailed sleep tracking and the realtime stress monitor as stress is something ive personally been trying to be more mindful of ive learned that my stress levels really skyrocket while im taking public transport for instance and adjust accordingly after about a dozen tries i wasnt able to log a successful ecg reading i kept getting errors even after switching wrists and the positioning of my arms thats been disappointing as im interested to see my results the blood pressure insights are neat and assuming other users can successfully record ecg readings its easy to see the potential benefit that said i dont think i need those features in my daily life yet so the whoop life membership probably wouldnt be the right pick for me im not totally sold on the whoop mgs aesthetics i have small hands and wrists so i always feel like smart devices tend to look clunky on me i definitely felt like the whoop was too big for me but the whoop mg doesnt bother me quite as much thats just my personal taste and there are lots of whoop accessories you can buy to spiff up the device for different occasions after just a few days theres a lot i can still learn from the whoop mg but i feel like id personally reach for the whoop the range of membership options helps ensure that users dont have to break the bank so id feel comfortable recommending whoop and whoop mg to my friends and family and for existing whoop customers who are thinking about an upgrade the extended battery life alone is worth considering", "author": null, "publishedAt": "", "source": "", "url":

david joyner said in an interview with cnbc referring to markets that the insurance unit operates in and higher medical costs so i think why youre not seeing a surprise on our part is because we actually plan for elevated trends going into this year he added joyner said the company is watching for the potential impact from president s planned tariffs on pharmaceuticals imported into the us on

return to hospitals for procedures they delayed during the pandemic but for the first time in several quarters cvs insurance business appeared to show some signs of improvement the units medical benefit ratio a measure of total medical expenses paid relative to premiums collected decreased to from a year earlier a lower ratio typically indicates that a company collected more in premiums than it paid out in benefits resulting in higher profitability cvs said the move partly reflects stronger underlying performance in its medicare business and improved medicare advantage star ratings for

companys focus on movement we have many decades of work ahead perez wrote in a letter to investors in march we hope you join us on this journey cnbc spoke to current and former hinge employees investors and people close to perez for this story some of whom asked not to be named in order to provide candid commentary hinge uses software to help patients treat acute musculoskeletal injuries chronic pain and carry out postsurgery rehabilitation remotely large employers like and cover the costs so their employees can access hinges appbased virtual physical therapy as well as its wearable electrical nerve stimulation device called enso the company its technology can help users manage pain cut down healthcare costs and reduce the need for surgery and opioids revenue increased to million

raised outside funding the biggest institutional shareholders are venture firms insight partners and atomico which own and of the stock respectively according to the filing perez and gabriel mecklenburg hinges executive chairman started the company in the pair met while they were both pursuing phds in the uk perez at the university of oxford and mecklenburg at imperial college london they were distracted students according to perezs twin brother david by the time they launched hinge perez and mecklenburg had already cofounded two other ventures together one was the oxbridge biotech roundtable an organization that connected academics and industry experts the other was marblar which worked to commercialize academic intellectual property perez took a leave of absence from oxford while working on marblar and never returned his brother wasnt a fan of the decision initially i gave him terrible advice said david perez a graduate of yale law school and partner at perkins coie in seattle i was like i think youre an idiot i think you should focus on your phd only an idiot would not finish a phd at oxford the twins have two older siblings their mother immigrated from cuba in followed years later by their father their parents met in miami got married after just three dates and are still together after more than years the family moved from miami to salt lake city utah in perezs mother was a substitute teacher and his father worked at restaurants as a dishwasher and busboy david perez said their father worked around the clock and used to call out orders in his sleep it wasnt a lot of money i think combined they made about a year david perez said but they stitched it together and raised four kids the twin boys were competitive particularly when it came to academics and playing basketball in the driveway david said his brother got great grades and always had an inclination toward science and medicine graduating from high school at age and then starting college at westminster university a small liberal arts school in utah i swear david perez said there were times where the only punishment that my mom could issue that would have the sting was restricting our ability to do homework perez was a student in the honors college at westminster and he graduated with a degree in biology richard badenhausen dean of the honors college described perez as an independent thinker and an ambitious student especially for his age he didnt care too much what people thought about him which is a strength in my book badenhausen said in an interview when perez was he was hit by a car he broke an arm and a leg and had to be airlifted to a nearby hospital after three surgeries and months of rehab he had a newfound interest in orthopedics and physical therapy mecklenburg had a serious injury of his own tearing his anterior cruciate ligament acl during a judo match which also required a year of rehab according to hinges website one day in october the pair put their heads together and outlined the tools they wished were available while undergoing physical therapy musculoskeletal conditions affect as many as billion people worldwide according to hinges prospectus so there was no shortage of opportunities they had the early concept of hinge within hours and a prototype ready by december of that year in hinges early days perez and mecklenburg would meet every saturday morning to talk shop now as theyve aged and started families they meet on wednesday nights according to colleagues perez welcomed his first child with his wife late last year seeing the growth over the last six seven eight years has just been unbelievable said jon reynolds a tech founder who contributed to hinges seed funding round that comes down to the quality of dan and gabriel as leaders they complement each other really well and theyve obviously got that mutual respect perez is a handson ceo who expects a lot from his staff hes direct detailoriented opinionated competitive and can be intense according to current and former employees but hes committed to the mission and the wellbeing of his employees they said hes one of those rare founder ceos who i think can go all the way said paul kruszewski a former hinge employee who joined the company after it acquired his canadian computer vision startup wrnch in employees say perez is a voracious reader often finishing two to four books a month that includes books about business and leadership an important source of information given that hinge was his first real job hes a fan of the innovators prescription by and others crossing the chasm by geoffrey moore and the long fix by dr vivian lee he also likes his staffers to read executives will often prepare to discuss chapters from a book in their meetings id come home and thered be a package from dan and its a book said sturm who led partnerships and new market development at hinge that was just the norm sturm who has worked in the healthcare and benefits space for around years said hinge was very deliberate with hiring so there wasnt a lot of turnover among senior executives he said hinges recruitment process was the hardest hes ever experienced another danism as sturm called it is hinges philosophy around writing perez has employees write memos typically up to six pages long instead of preparing slide decks or other materials ahead of meetings perez was inspired by a similar practice at according to current and former employees and sees it as a way to force employees to think through what they want to say instead of hiding behind bullet points hinges memo culture can be an adjustment particularly for new employees sturm said he thought the practice was insane at first but ultimately came to appreciate it and said it improved his pitches when you sort of sit back you go you know actually he wasnt wrong sturm said hinge has come a long way since venture firm atomico led the million series a investment in the londonbased firm said in a at the time that it was extremely impressed by daniel and gabriel and their determination to tackle a big problem in society carolina brochado led the round though she left atomico a year later and now works at investment firm eqt group she said that getting hinge to the brink of an ipo was a one in a million chance but noted that the company has managed to build a sizable business in digital health despite having so many odds stacked against it lots of learnings along the way of course like a big tech correction in the middle brochado said in an interview but it really is one of those rare examples of just an enormous market that was under penetrated for david perez whose firm now serves as hinges outside counsel watching the startup grow has been fascinating he said im a partner at a major law firm he said and i am only the second most successful twin but i think im okay with that", "author": null, "publishedAt": "", "source": "", "url":

grip on the booming weight loss market heres a recap of what sparked the panic on thursday if you missed it s pharmacy benefit manager caremark said it s wegovy on its standard formularies on july making that weekly injection the preferred glp drug for obesity as part of the move caremark will also drop eli lillys weight loss drug zepbound from those formularies which represent tens of millions of patients caremark negotiated an undisclosed lower net price for wegovy over zepbound on its standard formularies offering savings on novo nordisks drug to clients that opt into those plans but employers and unions will ultimately determine how much of those savings on wegovy get shared with members cvs said wegovys list price before insurance is for a months supply while zepbounds is that decision by one of the nations largest pbms triggered fears of a price war in the weight loss drug market and concerns that zepbounds sales momentum could stall shares of eli lilly plunged on thursday but several wall street analysts said the selloff was overblown in our view the novocvs deal does not represent the beginning of an obesity pricing war between lilly novo bmo capital markets analyst evan seigerman said in a note on thursday he added that in discussions with the companies both lilly and novo emphasized they want to expand patient access not undercut each other on price that may be reassuring to investors worried that a price war could hurt profit margins but the high list price of those weight loss drugs may remain a major barrier for many patients particularly those whose health plans dont cover the medications eli lilly told the firm it is not interested in exclusive oneofone deals with pbms while novo nordisk said cvs approached the drugmaker about the wegovy agreement according to seigerman on an earnings call on thursday eli lilly ceo david ricks said the company has been trying to move away from setting high list prices and paying bigger rebates to pbms for preferential coverage instead eli lilly is trying to set list prices closer to what it expects the plans to pay for its drugs we have been very vocal about trying to move away from that ricks said referring to deep pbm rebates he added that zepbound is still growing market share seigerman agreed saying that eli lilly is continuing to perform where it matters zepbound and the companys diabetes drug mounjaro now make up over half of us glp prescriptions outpacing the combined share of novo nordisks wegovy and its diabetes treatment ozempic according to seigerman that marketshare traction clearly demonstrates that physicians and patients prefer zepbound over wegovy bernstein analyst courtney breen wrote in a separate note on thursday its unclear how much the cvs formulary change will appeal to employers especially given that zepbound is known to be more effective at promoting weight loss than wegovy some patients on the standard formularies may also try to stay on their current zepbound prescriptions by requesting exemptions jpmorgan analyst chris schott said in a thursday note eli lillys ricks also said cvs move mainly affects smaller employers who are more likely to stick with caremarks standard formularies larger companies covering more patients often use customized formularies meaning they can still decide to include zepbound regardless the cvswegovy deal overshadowed for eli lilly the companys firstquarter revenue and earnings topped estimates on skyrocketing demand for zepbound and mounjaro both of which raked in billions of dollars in sales for the

by whoop the new hardware is also smaller than the previous device with a processor thats faster the company said weve taken everything weve learned over the past decade and built a platform to help our members perform and live at their peak for longer whoop founder and ceo said in a release the launch marks whoops first major hardware update since when the company released whoop whoop said its new devices will help users understand how their daily decisions impact their performance and outcomes over time according to a release there are three annual membership tiers whoop one which costs and includes the whoop whoop peak which costs and includes the whoop and whoop life which costs and includes the whoop mg accessories like additional bands will come at an extra cost whoop and whoop mg memberships and accessories are available for purchase online starting on thursday whoop one members will be able to use their whoop to measure sleep strain and recovery as well as the cardiovascular and muscular impact of various workouts users can also track their menstrual cycles and pregnancies whoop peak builds on those core metrics members have access to a health monitor feature which provides a quick look at vitals like respiratory rate heart rate blood oxygen and skin temperature whoop peak also supports a realtime stress monitor where users can see their stress level and complete guided breathing sessions if theyd like to increase relaxation or alertness the company also unveiled a feature called healthspan which uses nine metrics to calculate adult users whoop age and pace of aging a users whoop age compares their physiological age to their actual age and pace of aging assesses how fast or slow someone is aging based on their behavior the healthspan feature is updated every week and users will get tips about how they can improve their whoop age and pace of aging in their app whoop developed this feature in partnership with the buck institute for research on aging the company said the most comprehensive membership is whoop life which will give users access to additional medicalgrade health features with whoop mg whoop life members can record an electrocardiogram or an ecg to detect irregular heart rhythms like afib high heart rate or low heart rate once the reading is complete they can share a pdf of the recording with their doctor the ecg feature has been cleared by the us food and drug administration its not intended for users under years old or for users with a cardiac pacemaker or other implanted devices it will be available in the us the uae and qatar at launch with additional countries coming soon whoop life members can also get daily insights about their blood pressure including estimated systolic and diastolic ranges users will have to log a traditional cuffreading to act as a baseline to unlock this feature and its not intended for treatment diagnosis or medical use whoop said blood pressure insights has been in development for several years and the feature is currently in beta i got a sneak peek at the whoop mg and ive been wearing it for the past few days i cant speak to what its like to wear the device over an extended period but my initial experience has been largely positive from a hardware standpoint the whoop mg looks and feels sleeker than the whoop which i tested out in april the actual sensor is roughly an inch wide and the band is slightly thinner than that ive found that both the whoop mg and the whoop are a little hard to take off you really have to tug on the latch the whoop mgs setup is very straightforward and i was up and running on the app in a matter of minutes with all the new features theres a lot of additional data to make sense of so the app seemed pretty busy to me at first i felt like i had a better handle on it after a few hours though and i havent felt pressure to constantly monitor it of the new features i thought healthspan was particularly interesting as a relatively healthy yearold i noticed i still felt relieved to be younger than my age id be curious to see how that feature would change based on my behaviors from week to week i also liked the whoop mgs detailed sleep tracking and the realtime stress monitor as stress is something ive personally been trying to be more mindful of ive learned that my stress levels really skyrocket while im taking public transport for instance and adjust accordingly after about a dozen tries i wasnt able to log a successful ecg reading i kept getting errors even after switching wrists and the positioning of my

{"title": "walgreens doubles down on robots to fill prescriptions amid turnaround push", "description": "", "content": "as work to regain their footing is doubling down on the company is expanding the number of retail stores served by its microfulfillment centers which use robots to fill thousands of prescriptions for patients who take medications to manage or treat diabetes high blood pressure and other conditions walgreens aims to free up time for pharmacy staff reducing their routine tasks and eliminating inventory waste fewer prescription fills would allow employees to interact directly with patients and perform more clinical services such as vaccinations and testing walgreens first rolled out the robotpowered centers in but paused expansion in to focus on gathering feedback and improving performance at existing sites after more than a year of making upgrades including new internal tools the company said it is ready to expand the reach of that technology again walgreens told cnbc it hopes to have its microfulfillment centers serve more than stores by the end of the year up from in february and in october as of february the centers handled of the prescription volume on average at supported pharmacies according to walgreens that translates to around million prescriptions filled each month across the different sites the company said the renewed automation push comes as walgreens prepares to go private in a roughly with sycamore partners expected to close by the end of the year the deal would cap a turbulent chapter for walgreens as a public company marked by a rocky transition out of the pandemic declining pharmacy reimbursement rates weaker consumer spending and fierce competition from and other retail giants like cvs walgreens has shifted from opening new stores to closing hundreds of underperforming locations to shore up profits both companies are racing to stay relevant as online retailers lure away customers and patients increasingly opt for fast home delivery over traditional pharmacy visits the changes also follow mounting discontent among pharmacy staff in nationwide walkouts spotlighted burnout and chronic understaffing forcing chains to reexamine their operational models walgreens said the investment in robotic pharmacy fills is already paying off to date microfulfillment centers have generated approximately million in savings by cutting excess inventory and boosting efficiency said kayla heffington walgreens pharmacy operating model vice president heffington added that stores using the facilities are administering more vaccines than those that arent right now theyre the backbone to really help us offset some of the workload in our stores to obviously allow more time for our pharmacists and technicians to spend time with patients said rick gates walgreens chief pharmacy officer it gives us a lot more flexibility to bring down costs to increase the care and increase speed to therapy all those things he said gates added that the centers give walgreens a competitive advantage because independent pharmacies and some rivals dont have centralized support for their stores still and have similarly tested or their own microfulfillment facilities to dispense grocery items and other prescriptions microfulfillment centers come with their own risks such as a heavy reliance on sophisticated robotics that can cause disruptions if errors occur but the facilities are becoming a permanent fixture in retail due to the cost savings they offer and their ability to streamline workflows reduce the burden on employees and deliver goods to customers faster when a walgreens retail pharmacy receives a prescription the system determines whether it should be filled at that location or routed to a nearby microfulfillment center maintenance medications or prescription drugs taken regularly to manage chronic health conditions and refills that dont require immediate pickup are often sent to microfulfillment at the core of each facility is a highly automated system that uses robotics conveyor belts and barcode scanners among other tools to fill prescriptions the operations are supported by a team of pharmacists pharmacy technicians and other professionals instead of staff members filling prescriptions by hand at stores pill bottles move through an automated and carefully choreographed assembly line pharmacy technicians fill canisters with medications for robot pods to dispense and pharmacists verify those canisters to make sure they are accurate yellow robotic arms grab a labeled prescription vial and hold it up to a canister which precisely dispenses the specific medication for that bottle certain prescriptions are filled at separate manual stations including inhalers and birth control pill packs each prescription is then sorted and packaged for delivery back to retail pharmacy locations for final pickup there are other security and safety measures throughout the process said ahlam antar registered group supervisor of a microfulfillment center in mansfield massachusetts for example the robot pods automatically lock and signal an error with a redorange light if a worker attaches a canister to the wrong dispenser preventing the incorrect pills from going in a prescription she said properly training workers at the centers to ensure accuracy and patient safety is also crucial according to sarah gonsalves a senior certified pharmacy technician at the mansfield site she said a core part of her role is to make sure that technicians can correctly perform the different tasks in the process antar who has worked at the mansfield site since its opening said walgreens has made improvements to the microfulfillment process after considering feedback from stores and patients during the paused expansion that includes establishing new roles needed to support the process at the sites such as a training manager for all locations the facilities also plan to transition to using smaller prescription vials after hearing concerns that the current bottles are too large according to a walgreens spokesperson they said that will allow the centers to ship more prescriptions per order and reduce costs heffington said the automated locations have helped reduce walgreens overall prescription fulfillment costs by nearly compared to a year ago she said walgreens has also increased prescription volume by yearoveryear now filling more than million prescriptions annually the company hopes to raise that number to million or even more heffington added that walgreens implemented new internal tools to track the work across all centers and provide realtime data on where a patients prescription is in the microfulfillment process if a patient called the store and said hey can you tell me where my prescription is today workers can do that with great specificity thanks to the new tools heffington said despite the companys progress gates said there is more work to be done with microfulfillment centers for example he pointed to the possibility of shipping prescriptions directly to patients doorsteps instead of putting that burden on retail stores its only step one right now he said other improvements may still be needed at facilities according to some reports for example wral news in april that some customers at a walgreens store in garner north carolina say they are only getting partial prescription fills with several pills missing or their medicine is being delayed before brian ganges arizona store started relying on an automated facility he walked into the pharmacy every morning knowing that a massive list of prescriptions was in his work queue waiting to be filled for the day now with help from microfulfillment that list is significantly smaller each day according to gange we dont have to spend as much time on just those repetitive fulfillment tasks he told cnbc it really takes a huge weight off our shoulders gange said that gives him and his team time to step behind the pharmacy counter and interact with customers facetoface answering questions providing advice performing health tests or administering vaccines that kind of attention can make all the difference for a patient for example gange recalls stepping away for five minutes to take a patients blood pressure despite being overwhelmed with tasks while working at a different walgreens location several years ago he ended up sending that person to the emergency room because their blood pressure was off the charts that patients wife visited the pharmacy the next day to thank gange saying her husband probably wouldnt be here with us today without that blood pressure test i shouldnt have to question whether i have that five or minutes to check a blood pressure for a patient gange said microfulfillment and centralized services are really what are going to allow us to be able to do that to have that time that really allows us to provide better care for them he added",

prices of some medicine in the us to the significantly lower ones abroad trump signed an executive order including several different actions to renew that effort known as the most favored nation policy he did not refer to specific nations but signaled that he would target other developed countries because there are some countries that need some additional help and thats fine basically what were doing is equalizing trump said during a press event on monday we are going to pay the lowest price there is in the world we will get whoever is paying the lowest price thats the price that were going to get white house officials did not disclose which medications the order will apply to but said it will impact the commercial market as well as medicare and medicaid they said mondays announcement will be broader than a similar policy that trump tried to push during his first term which only applied to medicare part b drugs officials added that the administration will have a particular focus on drugs that have the largest disparities and largest expenditures which could include popular weight loss and diabetes treatments called glp drugs its unclear how effective the policy will be at lowering costs for patients in a social media post on monday trump claimed drug prices will be cut by plus but trump during the press event claimed drug prices may fall even more between and or i guess even some wall street analysts and other experts also questioned whether the policy can be implemented in a note on monday jpmorgan analysts called the policy challenging to practically implement because it would likely require congressional approval and could run into legal hurdles it is trumps latest effort to try to rein in us prescription drug prices which are in other developed nations and up to times more than in certain countries according to the rand corp a public policy think tank in a statement on monday the pharmaceutical industrys biggest lobbying group phrma lauded trump for taking aim at other nations not paying their fair share still phrmas ceo stephen ubl said importing foreign prices from socialist countries would be a bad deal for american patients and workers because it would hurt the industrys ability to bring them new treatments some experts have said the order could face challenges from the pharmaceutical industry in court despite the order shares of us drugmakers rose monday s stock added more than while and climbed more than aarp which advocates for older americans thanked trump for issuing the order in a statement on monday for too long big drug companies have been ripping off americas seniorscharging the highest prices in the world for lifesaving prescriptions padding their profits at the expense of american lives and forcing older adults to skip medications they cant afford aarps chief advocacy and engagement officer nancy leamond said in the statement part of the order takes aim at nations abroad which have more power to negotiate down drug prices with pharmaceutical companies starting today the united states will no longer subsidize the health care of foreign countries which is what we were doing trump said adding the us will no longer tolerate profiteering and price gouging from big pharma he added that it was really the countries that forced big pharma to do things that frankly im not sure they really felt comfortable doing the order directs the office of the us trade representative and the department of commerce to crack down on unreasonable and discriminatory policies in foreign countries that suppress drug prices abroad the officials said we are going to be working to make sure that countries arent being unfair in their negotiations with pharmaceutical companies right one official said drugmakers are constantly complaining about being put in an untenable situation when in these negotiations because those companies typically have to broker drug discounts with entire countries the official added unlike the us several foreign countries offer universal health coverage where the government is the sole payer giving it significant leverage to negotiate or set drug prices white house officials said they expect drugmakers to provide discounts across the board to reciprocate the actions the trump administration is taking to address prices abroad trumps order also directs the secretary of the department of health and human services to establish a pathway for us patients to buy their drugs directly from manufacturers at most favored nation prices bypassing middlemen were going to cut out the middlemen and facilitate the direct sale of drugs at the most favorite nation price directly to the american citizen trump said within days the secretary will also have to set clear targets for price reductions across all markets in the us according to the officials that will open up a round of negotiations between hhs and the pharmaceutical industry officials said not providing exact details on the nature of those talks if adequate progress is not made toward those price targets hhs secretary robert f kennedy jr will impose the most favored nation pricing on drugs through rulemaking the order also directs the food and drug administration to consider expanding imports from other developed nations beyond canada trump in april directing the fda to improve by which states can apply to import lowercost drugs from canada among other actions intended to lower drug prices mondays order also directs the department of justice and federal trade commission to aggressively enforce anticompetitive actions that keep prices high in the us the department of commerce will also consider export restrictions that fuel and enable that low pricing abroad drugmakers have argued that the most favored nation policy would hurt their profits and ultimately their ability to research and develop new medicines white house officials contended that pharmaceutical companies will continue to make money after the price cuts if they realize that the us alone is not going to pay for innovation and if they increase prices abroad to get additional revenue there drugmakers should pursue deals where they get financially rewarded commensurate the value that they are providing to other nations health systems one official said other countries should pay research and development too its for their benefit trump added on monday the industry also lobbied against similar trump plans during his first term he tried to in the final months of that term but a federal judge the effort from the pharmaceutical industry the biden administration then rescinded that policy white house officials congressional republicans to include a most favored nation provision in the major reconciliation bill they plan to pass in the coming months but the policy would have specifically targeted medicaid drug costs politico reported earlier this month several gop members opposed that measure the industrys largest trade group phrma that trumps medicaid proposal could cost drugmakers as much as trillion over a decade some health policy experts have said a most favored nation drug policy may not be effective at lowering medication costs for example the policy cant undo the basic economics of the global drug marketplace where of pharmaceutical profits worldwide come from the us facing a choice between deep cuts in their us pricing or the loss of weakly profitable overseas markets we can expect many firms to pull out from overseas markets at their earliest opportunity experts said in a report in april that will leave americans paying the same amount for medications drugmakers with lower profits and future generations of patients with less innovation they said in sum everyone loses the experts said even if the drug industry pushes back on trumps executive order in court his administration still has another tool to push down drug prices medicare drug price negotiations its a key provision of the inflation reduction act that gives medicare the power to negotiate certain prescription drug prices with manufacturers for the first time in history trump last month proposed a change to that policy that drugmakers have long sought lawmakers on both sides of the aisle could be receptive to the idea which proposes changing rules that differentiate between smallmolecule drugs and biologic medicines trump last week said he plans to announce tariffs on medicines imported into the us within the next two weeks those planned levies aim to boost domestic drug manufacturing drugmakers including and are pushing back on those potential duties some companies have questioned whether the tariffs are necessary given that several of them have already since trump

ahead could be muddy the analysts wrote in a note while experts backed the idea of lowering prices they raised doubts about whether other nations and drugmakers will do what trump hopes to accomplish with the order were unlikely to get the drug companies to voluntarily decrease their prices and were not going to get the other countries to voluntarily increase their prices right said gerard anderson professor of health policy and management at the johns hopkins bloomberg school of public health trumps order takes aim in part at other countries many of which have singlepayer health systems with more leverage to negotiate down drug prices with manufacturers in contrast the us has a patchwork of public and private insurance and partly relies on middlemen to set prices the presidents policy directs the office of the us trade representative and the department of commerce to fight what the administration called unreasonable and discriminatory policies in foreign countries that unfairly undercut market prices and drive price hikes in the united states in a statement on monday the pharmaceutical industrys biggest lobbying group phrma lauded trump for taking aim at other nations for what they deemed not paying their fair share but other countries governments are simply negotiating within the limits of their national health budgets not using unfair methods like trump claims said lawrence gostin a professor of public health law at georgetown university he added that they are securing fair prices for their own countries which has nothing to do with undercutting the us its unclear what actions the us could take to force other nations to take action but anderson said there is currently no incentive for them to hike their prices they have a system that works for them and they get lower prices countries like france and switzerland are all not going to sit there and say hey now i want to pay more he said the pharmaceutical industry would likely want to to see price hikes in countries within the european union before it voluntarily lowers any drug prices in the us jpmorgan analysts said that makes other pieces of the executive order appear unlikely to come to pass trumps order directs the health and human services secretary to establish a way for us patients to buy their drugs directly from manufacturers at most favored nation prices cutting out middlemen the order mentions directtoconsumer purchasing programs without further details his plan also calls for hhs secretary robert f kennedy jr to give drugmakers price reduction targets within the next days which will open up negotiations with the companies if adequate progress is not made toward those goals within six months of the order being signed hhs will impose most favored nation pricing on drugs through rulemaking or other aggressive measures according to the order but anderson said it would likely take far longer for the government and drugmakers to agree on a price under a provision of the inflation reduction act medicare and drug manufacturers typically take six months to a year to negotiate prices he added why would any drug company ever lower their prices voluntarily anderson noted that the order did not provide details on the exact actions the administration could take against drugmakers who dont agree so the incentives are unclear the department of justice and federal trade commission will also take action against anticompetitive actions that keep prices high in the us white house officials said there will be an expectation that those prices should come down and then if they dont we will be looking at our various policy levers that can be used to force those prices down one official said we absolutely are going to get a better deal the order also directs the food and drug administration to consider expanding imports from other developed nations beyond canada trump signed a separate executive order in april directing the fda to improve the process by which states can apply to import lowercost drugs from canada among other actions intended to lower drug prices the trump administration claims that some drug prices will fall by up to almost immediately white house officials also said the administration will have a particular focus on drugs that have the largest disparities and largest expenditures which could include popular weight loss and diabetes treatments called glp drugs but experts cast doubts on whether the administration can cut prices significantly as its still unclear which drugs and nations will be targeted and whether other countries and drugmakers will comply we dont know the list of nations included said tricia neuman executive director for the program on medicare policy at kff a health policy research group their pricing would make a big difference in what our prices would be which could then affect access in the us in andersons view the order as written wont be effective at lowering drug prices its a great idea to pay international prices but its how you get to implement it there are no details and ability to effectuate it he said gostin also added that americans will likely not see lower prices in the foreseeable future still aarp which advocates for older americans thanked trump for issuing the order in a statement on monday its safe to say that we are excited about any attempts to help bring down prescription drug prices said leigh purvis the prescription drug policy principal in aarps public policy institute this approach is unusually understandable to the public because i think theres a general understanding that america does pay the highest prescription drug prices in the world she added that the devil is in the details and thats what were looking forward to seeing more of the pharmaceutical industry has argued that a most favored nation policy will hurt its profits and ability to research and develop new drugs last week phrma even that trumps proposal if applied to the medicaid program specifically could cost drugmakers as much as trillion over a decade but mondays executive order seems to be more of a headline risk than the sweeping shift for the pharmaceutical industry many had feared bmo capital markets analyst evan seigerman said in a note on monday he pointed to the uncertain path forward for the plan saying it could be more rhetoric than actual implementable policy seigerman added that trump appeared to be somewhat sympathetic to us manufacturers with the president arguing that european nations are not supporting drug research and development due to their lower prices anderson said the pharmaceutical industry may be breathing a sigh of relief today pending further details on what the administrations retaliatory actions could look like trumps order suggests that it is ultimately voluntary for drugmakers to lower prices and subsequently profits so he did not propose something that is mandatory and really has teeth here still while phrma agreed with trumps decision to target other countries the group emphasized that importing foreign prices from socialist countries would be a bad deal for american patients and workers it would mean less treatments and cures and would jeopardize the hundreds of billions our member companies are planning to invest in america threatening jobs hurting our economy and making us more reliant on china for innovative medicines the group said in a statement some analysts and experts said trump could alternatively implement his most favored nation policy through an existing tool to push down drug prices its a key provision of the biden administrations inflation reduction act that gives medicare the power to negotiate certain prescription drug prices with manufacturers the federal program is currently in its of talks with drugmakers the trump administration could use the most favored nation price for a given drug as the initial offer to manufacturers at the beginning of negotiations anderson said youd be starting the negotiation at an even lower price than they have in the past he said adding that it would not require any help from congress jpmorgan analysts added that we see a clearer pathway for the administration to implement the most favored nation policy at a smaller scale through medicare ira price negotiations where the impact would be limited to a small

drugs eligible for the third round of price talks by february which will then kick off months of back and forth between the government and manufacturers if they agree to participate the new negotiated prices for those products will go into effect in but here are the biggest changes this time around this draft guidance is critical to creating a transparent competitive and fair prescription drug market that puts american patients first medicare director chris klomp said in a but wall street analysts are focused on another part of the guidance that could cause issues for and some other pharmaceutical companies the guidance document suggests that the trump administration could end a workaround that those companies are using to drag out revenue from topearning cancer drugs such as mercks keytruda and bristol myers squibbs opdivo the plan had been to shift patients to newer injectable or subcutaneous versions of their cancer drugs and keep charging medicare higher prices for them even after their original intravenous versions are subject to new negotiated prices under the program drugmakers have been banking on those subcutaneous versions as a way to dampen the revenue they would lose from medicare drug price negotiations along with upcoming patent expirations for the original forms of their drugs for example key patents for keytruda start expiring in under the current rules complex drugs known as biologics are eligible for the negotiation process after years but the clock restarts for a new version of the drug like a subcutaneous form that adds an additional active ingredient subcutaneous versions of drugs like opdivo are combination products that include an additional ingredient allowing them to be injected quickly instead of being slowly infused like the original intravenous form but on monday cms said it is soliciting comments on how it might consider grouping these combination drugs with their original versions if the added ingredient doesnt affect how the drug treats the underlying disease in other words the agency is considering whether to count two versions of a drug as a single product in certain cases that appears to be somewhat targeted at products such as subcutaneous keytruda and opdivo jpmorgan analysts said in a note on monday they said the guidance leads to at least the potential for inclusion of those

support clinicians in delivering highquality care and help people advocate for their health and that of their communities openai said in a to get there we need to ensure models are useful and safe the company said healthbench was developed alongside doctors from countries its based on conversations that simulate interactions between individual users or clinicians and ai models the discussions are split into seven different themes including global health emergency situations and handling uncertainty when a model responds to a prompt each response is graded against a set of physicianwritten rubric criteria specific to that conversation openai said healthbench contains unique rubric criteria openai included one example where a user said they found their yearold neighbor unresponsive on

the booming weight loss drug market the danish drugmaker on friday abruptly announced that longtime ceo lars fruergaard jrgensen is as its obesity injection wegovy loses ground to s rival treatment zepbound while eli lilly entered the market later it is emerging as the frontrunner in a space that some analysts believe could be worth more than billion by the early s novo nordisks new top executive will need to help the company close the gap with eli lilly fend off emerging rivals and navigate other challenges the next ceo will have to spearhead the companys plans to launch a new slate of weight loss drugs before key patents for wegovy expire and manage the impact of and president s its unclear who will take jrgensens place but the company said it is considering both internal and external candidates while novo nordisk took a commanding early lead in the obesity duopoly they have ceded ground at a critical moment when more competitors are quickly approaching bmo capital markets analyst evan seigerman said in a note friday referring to other drugmakers racing to market their own obesity treatments novo nordisk once held the title of europes most valuable company worth billion at its peak driven by skyrocketing demand for wegovy and its diabetes counterpart ozempic but investor enthusiasm has faded after eli lilly gained a bigger share of the market and clinical trial data on novo nordisks next wave of obesity drugs underwhelmed investors shares of novo nordisk have plunged more than over the past year wiping out more than billion in market value novo nordisks stock is still up more than since jrgensen took over as ceo in january but shares of eli lilly have gained about since that same month when ceo dave ricks took over the company mounting pressure also came from the powerful novo nordisk foundation the controlling shareholder of the danish drugmaker the foundation recently urged novo nordisks leadership to consider an accelerated ceo succession and pushed for greater board representation according to a on friday novo nordisk on friday said it jointly concluded with jrgensen that it was time to find a new ceo following the foundations request recent market challenges and the steep decline in the companys share price jrgensen said he did not see his ouster coming and was only informed of it recently according to several on friday days before the announcement novo nordisk slashed its sales and profit forecast for the first time since the launch of wegovy four years ago seigerman said its still unclear whether a new top executive will be able to address the companys challenges although it might satisfy some for investors to drive a ceo transition without meaningful change in nearterm strategy we continue to see a more difficult path forward he said novo nordisk has been ceding market share to eli lilly even though zepbounds dollar sales still trail wegovys zepbound and eli lillys diabetes drug mounjaro now make up over half of us prescriptions for socalled glps which mimic hormones to tamp down appetite and regulate blood sugar according to a separate note from seigerman earlier this month that outpaces the combined share of novo nordisks wegovy and ozempic new us prescriptions of zepbound surpassed those for wegovy for the first time in early march just months after the launch of eli lillys drug reported at the time by august some analysts were estimating that zepbound had captured of the us weight loss drug market hot on wegovys heels that marketshare traction clearly demonstrates that physicians and patients prefer zepbound over wegovy bernstein analyst courtney breen wrote in a note in early may realworld data and have shown that zepbound leads to more weight loss than wegovy novo nordisk has also struggled to convince wall street that its pipeline of nextgeneration weight loss drugs can help it maintain its position in the market especially after wegovy loses exclusivity and drugmakers can sell cheaper generic alternatives for example novo nordisk repeatedly told investors its cagrisema shot expected to be launched in would help people lose or more of their body weight but the in december sending shares of the company plunging the company in april said it has filed for us approval of an oral version of semaglutide the active ingredient in wegovy and ozempic it comes as drugmakers rush to develop more convenient weight loss pills which could account for billion of the market in the coming years according to some analyst but seigerman in a separate note in april said novo nordisk has no clear strategy for its oral obesity drug portfolio he said that is likely to challenge growth in the end of the decade especially as eli lillys own obesity pill impresses investors and inches closer to entering the market unlike oral semaglutide eli lillys pill is a smallmolecule drug and not a peptide medication that means eli lillys drug is absorbed more easily in the body and doesnt require dietary restrictions like oral semaglutide does which may be a notable advantage for the company seigerman acknowledged that novo nordisks experimental smallmolecule pill amycretin could be competitive long term but he said that wont happen soon as the drug is not expected to launch for several years outside of pipeline issues novo nordisk and the rest of the pharmaceutical industry are grappling with the trump administrations ambitions to lower drug prices and bring manufacturing to the us trump has said he plans to impose tariffs on pharmaceuticals imported into the us and signed an executive order that aims to novo nordisk made it clear that its strategy remains unchanged despite jrgensens abrupt exit we have a strong product portfolio with lots of potential novo nordisk board chairman helge lund said on a call with analysts friday we have an experienced executive team to continue to evolve and drive the company forward with a longterm perspective but seigerman said the decision to swap ceos seems to draw attention to pivots in this strategy that may be necessary investors have already been seeing potential signs of that shift according to seigerman novo nordisk has long prioritized peptidebased therapeutics but the companys recent dealmaking indicates that it is leaning heavier on oral small molecule solutions for the obesity market seigerman said the company last week announced with the us biotech company septerna for experimental smallmolecule pills for obesity and other cardiometabolic diseases but those pills are in early development and those products are years from entering the market meaning the agreement is still risky the same can be said of several of novo nordisks other recent tieups for example novo nordisk in march said it had up to billion for the rights to an early experimental drug from the chinese pharmaceutical company united laboratories international the newly acquired drug is a clear potential competitor to eli lillys socalled triple g obesity drug retatrutide because they both use a threepronged approach to promoting weight loss and regulating blood sugar but retatrutide is in latestage

mecklenburg hinges executive chairman started the company in the pair met while they were both pursuing phds in the uk perez at the university of oxford and mecklenburg at imperial college london they were distracted students according to perezs twin brother david by the time they launched hinge perez and mecklenburg had already cofounded two other ventures together one was the oxbridge biotech roundtable an organization that connected academics and industry experts the other was marblar which worked to commercialize academic intellectual property perez took a leave of absence from oxford while working on marblar and never returned his brother wasnt a fan of the decision initially i gave him terrible advice said david perez a graduate of yale law school and partner at perkins coie in seattle i was like i think youre an idiot i think you should focus on your phd only an idiot would not finish a phd at oxford the twins have two older siblings their mother immigrated from cuba in followed years later by their father their parents met in miami got married after just three dates and are still together after more than years the family moved from miami to salt lake city utah in perezs mother was a substitute teacher and his father worked at restaurants as a dishwasher and busboy david perez said their father worked around the clock and used to call out orders in his sleep it wasnt a lot of money i think combined they made about a year david perez said but they stitched it together and raised four kids the twin boys were competitive particularly when it came to academics and playing basketball in the driveway david said his brother got great grades and always had an inclination toward science and medicine graduating from high school at age and then starting college at westminster university a small liberal arts school in utah i swear david perez said there were times where the only punishment that my mom could issue that would have the sting was restricting our ability to do homework perez was a student in the honors college at westminster and he graduated with a degree in biology richard badenhausen dean of the honors college described perez as an independent thinker and an ambitious student especially for his age he didnt care too much what people thought about him which is a strength in my book badenhausen said in an interview when perez was he was hit by a car he broke an arm and a leg and had to be airlifted to a nearby hospital after three surgeries and months of rehab he had a newfound interest in orthopedics and physical therapy mecklenburg had a serious injury of his own tearing his anterior cruciate ligament acl during a judo match which also required a year of rehab according to hinges website one day in october the pair put their heads together and outlined the tools they wished were available while undergoing physical therapy musculoskeletal conditions affect as many as billion people worldwide according to hinges prospectus so there was no shortage of opportunities they had the early concept of hinge within hours and a prototype ready by december of that year in hinges early days perez and mecklenburg would meet every saturday morning to talk shop now as theyve aged and started families they meet on wednesday nights according to colleagues perez welcomed his first child with his wife late last year seeing the growth over the last six seven eight years has just been unbelievable said jon reynolds a tech founder who contributed to hinges seed funding round that comes down to the quality of dan and gabriel as leaders they complement each other really well and theyve obviously got that mutual respect perez is a handson ceo who expects a lot from his staff hes direct detailoriented opinionated competitive and can be intense according to current and former employees but hes committed to the mission and the wellbeing of his employees they said hes one of those rare founder ceos who i think can go all the way said paul kruszewski a former hinge employee who joined the company after it acquired his canadian computer vision startup wrnch in employees say perez is a voracious reader often finishing two to four books a month that includes books about business and leadership an important source of information given that hinge was his first real job hes a fan of the innovators prescription by and others crossing the chasm by geoffrey moore and the long fix by dr vivian lee he also likes his staffers to read executives will often prepare to discuss chapters from a book in their meetings id come home and thered be a package from dan and its a book said sturm who led partnerships and new market development at hinge that was just the norm sturm who has worked in the healthcare and benefits space for around years said hinge was very deliberate with hiring so there wasnt a lot of turnover among senior executives he said hinges recruitment process was the hardest hes ever experienced another danism as sturm called it is hinges philosophy around writing perez has employees write memos typically up to six pages long instead of preparing slide decks or other materials ahead of meetings perez was inspired by a similar practice at according to current and former employees and sees it as a way to force employees to think through what they want to say instead of hiding behind bullet points hinges memo culture can be an adjustment particularly for new employees sturm said he thought the practice was insane at first but ultimately came to appreciate it and said it improved his pitches when you sort of sit back you go you know actually he wasnt wrong sturm said hinge has come a long way since venture firm atomico led the million series a investment in the londonbased firm said in a at the time that it was extremely impressed by daniel and gabriel and their determination to tackle a big problem in society carolina brochado led the round though she left atomico a year later and now works at investment firm eqt group she said that getting hinge to the brink of an ipo was a one in a million chance but noted that the company has managed to build a sizable business in digital health despite having so many odds stacked against it lots of learnings along the way of course like a big tech correction in the middle brochado said in an interview but it really is one of those rare examples of just an enormous market that was under penetrated for david perez whose firm now serves as hinges outside counsel watching the startup grow has been fascinating he said im a partner at a major law firm he said and i am only the second most successful twin but i think im okay with that", "author": null, "publishedAt": "", "source": "", "url":

grip on the booming weight loss market heres a recap of what sparked the panic on thursday if you missed it s pharmacy benefit manager caremark said it s wegovy on its standard formularies on july making that weekly injection the preferred glp drug for obesity as part of the move caremark will also drop eli lillys weight loss drug zepbound from those formularies which represent tens of millions of patients caremark negotiated an undisclosed lower net price for wegovy over zepbound on its standard formularies offering savings on novo nordisks drug to clients that opt into those plans but employers and unions will ultimately determine how much of those savings on wegovy get shared with members cvs said wegovys list price before insurance is for a months supply while zepbounds is that decision by one of the nations largest pbms triggered fears of a price war in the weight loss drug market and concerns that zepbounds sales momentum could stall shares of eli lilly plunged on thursday but several wall street analysts said the selloff was overblown in our view the novocvs deal does not represent the beginning of an obesity pricing war between lilly novo bmo capital markets analyst evan seigerman said in a note on thursday he added that in discussions with the companies both lilly and novo emphasized they want to expand patient access not undercut each other on price that may be reassuring to investors worried that a price war could hurt profit margins but the high list price of those weight loss drugs may remain a major barrier for many patients particularly those whose health plans dont cover the medications eli lilly told the firm it is not interested in exclusive oneofone deals with pbms while novo nordisk said cvs approached the drugmaker about the wegovy agreement according to seigerman on an earnings call on thursday eli lilly ceo david ricks said the company has been trying to move away from setting high list prices and paying bigger rebates to pbms for preferential coverage instead eli lilly is trying to set list prices closer to what it expects the plans to pay for its drugs we have been very vocal about trying to move away from that ricks said referring to deep pbm rebates he added that zepbound is still growing market share seigerman agreed saying that eli lilly is continuing to perform where it matters zepbound and the companys diabetes drug mounjaro now make up over half of us glp prescriptions outpacing the combined share of novo nordisks wegovy and its diabetes treatment ozempic according to seigerman that marketshare traction clearly demonstrates that physicians and patients prefer zepbound over wegovy bernstein analyst courtney breen wrote in a separate note on thursday its unclear how much the cvs formulary change will appeal to employers especially given that zepbound is known to be more effective at promoting weight loss than wegovy some patients on the standard formularies may also try to stay on their current zepbound prescriptions by requesting exemptions jpmorgan analyst chris schott said in a thursday note eli lillys ricks also said cvs move mainly affects smaller employers who are more likely to stick with caremarks standard formularies larger companies covering more patients often use customized formularies meaning they can still decide to include zepbound regardless the cvswegovy deal overshadowed for eli lilly the companys firstquarter revenue and earnings topped estimates on skyrocketing demand for zepbound and mounjaro both of which raked in billions of dollars in sales for the

and additional inapp health insights both of the companys new devices are designed for wear the whoop and whoop mg support days of battery life which is around triple the fourtofiveday range offered by whoop the new hardware is also smaller than the previous device with a processor thats faster the company said weve taken everything weve learned over the past decade and built a platform to help our members perform and live at their peak for longer whoop founder and ceo said in a release the launch marks whoops first major hardware update since when the company released whoop whoop said its new devices will help users understand how their daily decisions impact their performance and outcomes over time according to a release there are three annual membership tiers whoop one which costs and includes the whoop whoop peak which costs and includes the whoop and whoop life which costs and includes the whoop mg accessories like additional bands will come at an extra cost whoop and whoop mg memberships and accessories are available for purchase online starting on thursday whoop one members will be able to use their whoop to measure sleep strain and recovery as well as the cardiovascular and muscular impact of various workouts users can also track their menstrual cycles and pregnancies whoop peak builds on those core metrics members have access to a health monitor feature which provides a quick look at vitals like respiratory rate heart rate blood oxygen and skin temperature whoop peak also supports a realtime stress monitor where users can see their stress level and complete guided breathing sessions if theyd like to increase relaxation or alertness the company also unveiled a feature called healthspan which uses nine metrics to calculate adult users whoop age and pace of aging a users whoop age compares their physiological age to their actual age and pace of aging assesses how fast or slow someone is aging based on their behavior the healthspan feature is updated every week and users will get tips about how they can improve their whoop age and pace of aging in their app whoop developed this feature in partnership with the buck institute for research on aging the company said the most comprehensive membership is whoop life which will give users access to additional medicalgrade health features with whoop mg whoop life members can record an electrocardiogram or an ecg to detect irregular heart rhythms like afib high heart rate or low heart rate once the reading is complete they can share a pdf of the recording with their doctor the ecg feature has been cleared by the us food and drug administration its not intended for users under years old or for users with a cardiac pacemaker or other implanted devices it will be available in the us the uae and qatar at launch with additional countries coming soon whoop life members can also get daily insights about their blood pressure including estimated systolic and diastolic ranges users will have to log a traditional cuffreading to act as a baseline to unlock this feature and its not intended for treatment diagnosis or medical use whoop said blood pressure insights has been in development for several years and the feature is currently in beta i got a sneak peek at the whoop mg and ive been wearing it for the past few days i cant speak to what its like to wear the device over an extended period but my initial experience has been largely positive from a hardware standpoint the whoop mg looks and feels sleeker than the whoop which i tested out in april the actual sensor is roughly an inch wide and the band is slightly thinner than that ive found that both the whoop mg and the whoop are a little hard to take off you really have to tug on the latch the whoop mgs setup is very straightforward and i was up and running on the app in a matter of minutes with all the new features theres a lot of additional data to make sense of so the app seemed pretty busy to me at first i felt like i had a better handle on it after a few hours though and i havent felt pressure to constantly monitor it of the new features i thought healthspan was particularly interesting as a relatively healthy yearold i noticed i still felt relieved to be younger than my age id be curious to see how that feature would change based on my behaviors from week to week i also liked the whoop mgs detailed sleep tracking and the realtime stress monitor as stress is something ive personally been trying to be more mindful of ive learned that my stress levels really skyrocket while im taking public transport for instance and adjust accordingly after about a dozen tries i wasnt able to log a successful ecg reading i kept getting errors even after switching wrists and the positioning of my arms thats been disappointing as im interested to see my results the blood pressure insights are neat and assuming other users can successfully record ecg readings its easy to see the potential benefit that said i dont think i need those features in my daily life yet so the whoop life membership probably wouldnt be the right pick for me im not totally sold on the whoop mgs aesthetics i have small hands and wrists so i always feel like smart devices tend to look clunky on me i definitely felt like the whoop was too big for me but the whoop mg doesnt bother me quite as much thats just my personal taste and there are lots of whoop accessories you can buy to spiff up the device for different occasions after just a few days theres a lot i can still learn from the whoop mg but i feel like id personally reach for the whoop the range of membership options helps ensure that users dont have to break the bank so id feel comfortable recommending whoop and whoop mg to my friends and family and for existing whoop customers who are thinking about an upgrade the extended battery life alone is worth considering", "author": null, "publishedAt": "", "source": "", "url":

{"title": "walgreens doubles down on robots to fill prescriptions amid turnaround push", "description": "", "content": "as work to regain their footing is doubling down on the company is expanding the number of retail stores served by its microfulfillment centers which use robots to fill thousands of prescriptions for patients who take medications to manage or treat diabetes high blood pressure and other conditions walgreens aims to free up time for pharmacy staff reducing their routine tasks and eliminating inventory waste fewer prescription fills would allow employees to interact directly with patients and perform more clinical services such as vaccinations and testing walgreens first rolled out the robotpowered centers in but paused expansion in to focus on gathering feedback and improving performance at existing sites after more than a year of making upgrades including new internal tools the company said it is ready to expand the reach of that technology again walgreens told cnbc it hopes to have its microfulfillment centers serve more than stores by the end of the year up from in february and in october as of february the centers handled of the prescription volume on average at supported pharmacies according to walgreens that translates to around million prescriptions filled each month across the different sites the company said the renewed automation push comes as walgreens prepares to go private in a roughly with sycamore partners expected to close by the end of the year the deal would cap a turbulent chapter for walgreens as a public company marked by a rocky transition out of the pandemic declining pharmacy reimbursement rates weaker consumer spending and fierce competition from and other retail giants like cvs walgreens has shifted from opening new stores to closing hundreds of underperforming locations to shore up profits both companies are racing to stay relevant as online retailers lure away customers and patients increasingly opt for fast home delivery over traditional pharmacy visits the changes also follow mounting discontent among pharmacy staff in nationwide walkouts spotlighted burnout and chronic understaffing forcing chains to reexamine their operational models walgreens said the investment in robotic pharmacy fills is already paying off to date microfulfillment centers have generated approximately million in savings by cutting excess inventory and boosting efficiency said kayla heffington walgreens pharmacy operating model vice president heffington added that stores using the facilities are administering more vaccines than those that arent right now theyre the backbone to really help us offset some of the workload in our stores to obviously allow more time for our pharmacists and technicians to spend time with patients said rick gates walgreens chief pharmacy officer it gives us a lot more flexibility to bring down costs to increase the care and increase speed to therapy all those things he said gates added that the centers give walgreens a competitive advantage because independent pharmacies and some rivals dont have centralized support for their stores still and have similarly tested or their own microfulfillment facilities to dispense grocery items and other prescriptions microfulfillment centers come with their own risks such as a heavy reliance on sophisticated robotics that can cause disruptions if errors occur but the facilities are becoming a permanent fixture in retail due to the cost savings they offer and their ability to streamline workflows reduce the burden on employees and deliver goods to customers faster when a walgreens retail pharmacy receives a prescription the system determines whether it should be filled at that location or routed to a nearby microfulfillment center maintenance medications or prescription drugs taken regularly to manage chronic health conditions and refills that dont require immediate pickup are often sent to microfulfillment at the core of each facility is a highly automated system that uses robotics conveyor belts and barcode scanners among other tools to fill prescriptions the operations are supported by a team of pharmacists pharmacy technicians and other professionals instead of staff members filling prescriptions by hand at stores pill bottles move through an automated and carefully choreographed assembly line pharmacy technicians fill canisters with medications for robot pods to dispense and pharmacists verify those canisters to make sure they are accurate yellow robotic arms grab a labeled prescription vial and hold it up to a canister which precisely dispenses the specific medication for that bottle certain prescriptions are filled at separate manual stations including inhalers and birth control pill packs each prescription is then sorted and packaged for delivery back to retail pharmacy locations for final pickup there are other security and safety measures throughout the process said ahlam antar registered group supervisor of a microfulfillment center in mansfield massachusetts for example the robot pods automatically lock and signal an error with a redorange light if a worker attaches a canister to the wrong dispenser preventing the incorrect pills from going in a prescription she said properly training workers at the centers to ensure accuracy and patient safety is also crucial according to sarah gonsalves a senior certified pharmacy technician at the mansfield site she said a core part of her role is to make sure that technicians can correctly perform the different tasks in the process antar who has worked at the mansfield site since its opening said walgreens has made improvements to the microfulfillment process after considering feedback from stores and patients during the paused expansion that includes establishing new roles needed to support the process at the sites such as a training manager for all locations the facilities also plan to transition to using smaller prescription vials after hearing concerns that the current bottles are too large according to a walgreens spokesperson they said that will allow the centers to ship more prescriptions per order and reduce costs heffington said the automated locations have helped reduce walgreens overall prescription fulfillment costs by nearly compared to a year ago she said walgreens has also increased prescription volume by yearoveryear now filling more than million prescriptions annually the company hopes to raise that number to million or even more heffington added that walgreens implemented new internal tools to track the work across all centers and provide realtime data on where a patients prescription is in the microfulfillment process if a patient called the store and said hey can you tell me where my prescription is today workers can do that with great specificity thanks to the new tools heffington said despite the companys progress gates said there is more work to be done with microfulfillment centers for example he pointed to the possibility of shipping prescriptions directly to patients doorsteps instead of putting that burden on retail stores its only step one right now he said other improvements may still be needed at facilities according to some reports for example wral news in april that some customers at a walgreens store in garner north carolina say they are only getting partial prescription fills with several pills missing or their medicine is being delayed before brian ganges arizona store started relying on an automated facility he walked into the pharmacy every morning knowing that a massive list of prescriptions was in his work queue waiting to be filled for the day now with help from microfulfillment that list is significantly smaller each day according to gange we dont have to spend as much time on just those repetitive fulfillment tasks he told cnbc it really takes a huge weight off our shoulders gange said that gives him and his team time to step behind the pharmacy counter and interact with customers facetoface answering questions providing advice performing health tests or administering vaccines that kind of attention can make all the difference for a patient for example gange recalls stepping away for five minutes to take a patients blood pressure despite being overwhelmed with tasks while working at a different walgreens location several years ago he ended up sending that person to the emergency room because their blood pressure was off the charts that patients wife visited the pharmacy the next day to thank gange saying her husband probably wouldnt be here with us today without that blood pressure test i shouldnt have to question whether i have that five or minutes to check a blood pressure for a patient gange said microfulfillment and centralized services are really what are going to allow us to be able to do that to have that time that really allows us to provide better care for them he added",

prices of some medicine in the us to the significantly lower ones abroad trump signed an executive order including several different actions to renew that effort known as the most favored nation policy he did not refer to specific nations but signaled that he would target other developed countries because there are some countries that need some additional help and thats fine basically what were doing is equalizing trump said during a press event on monday we are going to pay the lowest price there is in the world we will get whoever is paying the lowest price thats the price that were going to get white house officials did not disclose which medications the order will apply to but said it will impact the commercial market as well as medicare and medicaid they said mondays announcement will be broader than a similar policy that trump tried to push during his first term which only applied to medicare part b drugs officials added that the administration will have a particular focus on drugs that have the largest disparities and largest expenditures which could include popular weight loss and diabetes treatments called glp drugs its unclear how effective the policy will be at lowering costs for patients in a social media post on monday trump claimed drug prices will be cut by plus but trump during the press event claimed drug prices may fall even more between and or i guess even some wall street analysts and other experts also questioned whether the policy can be implemented in a note on monday jpmorgan analysts called the policy challenging to practically implement because it would likely require congressional approval and could run into legal hurdles it is trumps latest effort to try to rein in us prescription drug prices which are in other developed nations and up to times more than in certain countries according to the rand corp a public policy think tank in a statement on monday the pharmaceutical industrys biggest lobbying group phrma lauded trump for taking aim at other nations not paying their fair share still phrmas ceo stephen ubl said importing foreign prices from socialist countries would be a bad deal for american patients and workers because it would hurt the industrys ability to bring them new treatments some experts have said the order could face challenges from the pharmaceutical industry in court despite the order shares of us drugmakers rose monday s stock added more than while and climbed more than aarp which advocates for older americans thanked trump for issuing the order in a statement on monday for too long big drug companies have been ripping off americas seniorscharging the highest prices in the world for lifesaving prescriptions padding their profits at the expense of american lives and forcing older adults to skip medications they cant afford aarps chief advocacy and engagement officer nancy leamond said in the statement part of the order takes aim at nations abroad which have more power to negotiate down drug prices with pharmaceutical companies starting today the united states will no longer subsidize the health care of foreign countries which is what we were doing trump said adding the us will no longer tolerate profiteering and price gouging from big pharma he added that it was really the countries that forced big pharma to do things that frankly im not sure they really felt comfortable doing the order directs the office of the us trade representative and the department of commerce to crack down on unreasonable and discriminatory policies in foreign countries that suppress drug prices abroad the officials said we are going to be working to make sure that countries arent being unfair in their negotiations with pharmaceutical companies right one official said drugmakers are constantly complaining about being put in an untenable situation when in these negotiations because those companies typically have to broker drug discounts with entire countries the official added unlike the us several foreign countries offer universal health coverage where the government is the sole payer giving it significant leverage to negotiate or set drug prices white house officials said they expect drugmakers to provide discounts across the board to reciprocate the actions the trump administration is taking to address prices abroad trumps order also directs the secretary of the department of health and human services to establish a pathway for us patients to buy their drugs directly from manufacturers at most favored nation prices bypassing middlemen were going to cut out the middlemen and facilitate the direct sale of drugs at the most favorite nation price directly to the american citizen trump said within days the secretary will also have to set clear targets for price reductions across all markets in the us according to the officials that will open up a round of negotiations between hhs and the pharmaceutical industry officials said not providing exact details on the nature of those talks if adequate progress is not made toward those price targets hhs secretary robert f kennedy jr will impose the most favored nation pricing on drugs through rulemaking the order also directs the food and drug administration to consider expanding imports from other developed nations beyond canada trump in april directing the fda to improve by which states can apply to import lowercost drugs from canada among other actions intended to lower drug prices mondays order also directs the department of justice and federal trade commission to aggressively enforce anticompetitive actions that keep prices high in the us the department of commerce will also consider export restrictions that fuel and enable that low pricing abroad drugmakers have argued that the most favored nation policy would hurt their profits and ultimately their ability to research and develop new medicines white house officials contended that pharmaceutical companies will continue to make money after the price cuts if they realize that the us alone is not going to pay for innovation and if they increase prices abroad to get additional revenue there drugmakers should pursue deals where they get financially rewarded commensurate the value that they are providing to other nations health systems one official said other countries should pay research and development too its for their benefit trump added on monday the industry also lobbied against similar trump plans during his first term he tried to in the final months of that term but a federal judge the effort from the pharmaceutical industry the biden administration then rescinded that policy white house officials congressional republicans to include a most favored nation provision in the major reconciliation bill they plan to pass in the coming months but the policy would have specifically targeted medicaid drug costs politico reported earlier this month several gop members opposed that measure the industrys largest trade group phrma that trumps medicaid proposal could cost drugmakers as much as trillion over a decade some health policy experts have said a most favored nation drug policy may not be effective at lowering medication costs for example the policy cant undo the basic economics of the global drug marketplace where of pharmaceutical profits worldwide come from the us facing a choice between deep cuts in their us pricing or the loss of weakly profitable overseas markets we can expect many firms to pull out from overseas markets at their earliest opportunity experts said in a report in april that will leave americans paying the same amount for medications drugmakers with lower profits and future generations of patients with less innovation they said in sum everyone loses the experts said even if the drug industry pushes back on trumps executive order in court his administration still has another tool to push down drug prices medicare drug price negotiations its a key provision of the inflation reduction act that gives medicare the power to negotiate certain prescription drug prices with manufacturers for the first time in history trump last month proposed a change to that policy that drugmakers have long sought lawmakers on both sides of the aisle could be receptive to the idea which proposes changing rules that differentiate between smallmolecule drugs and biologic medicines trump last week said he plans to announce tariffs on medicines imported into the us within the next two weeks those planned levies aim to boost domestic drug manufacturing drugmakers including and are pushing back on those potential duties some companies have questioned whether the tariffs are necessary given that several of them have already since trump

systems with more leverage to negotiate down drug prices with manufacturers in contrast the us has a patchwork of public and private insurance and partly relies on middlemen to set prices the presidents policy directs the office of the us trade representative and the department of commerce to fight what the administration called unreasonable and discriminatory policies in foreign countries that unfairly undercut market prices and drive price hikes in the united states in a statement on monday the pharmaceutical industrys biggest lobbying group phrma lauded trump for taking aim at other nations for what they deemed not paying their fair share but other countries governments are simply negotiating within the limits of their national health budgets not using unfair methods like trump claims said lawrence gostin a professor of public health law at georgetown university he added that they are securing fair prices for their own countries which has nothing to do with undercutting the us its unclear what actions the us could take to force other nations to take action but anderson said there is currently no incentive for them to hike their prices they have a system that works for them and they get lower prices countries like france and switzerland are all not going to sit there and say hey now i want to pay more he said the pharmaceutical industry would likely want to to see price hikes in countries within the european union before it voluntarily lowers any drug prices in the us jpmorgan analysts said that makes other pieces of the executive order appear unlikely to come to pass trumps order directs the health and human services secretary to establish a way for us patients to buy their drugs directly from manufacturers at most favored nation prices cutting out middlemen the order mentions directtoconsumer purchasing programs without further details his plan also calls for hhs secretary robert f kennedy jr to give drugmakers price reduction targets within the next days which will open up negotiations with the companies if adequate progress is not made toward those goals within six months of the order being signed hhs will impose most favored nation pricing on drugs through rulemaking or other aggressive measures according to the order but anderson said it would likely take far longer for the government and drugmakers to agree on a price under a provision of the inflation reduction act medicare and drug manufacturers typically take six months to a year to negotiate prices he added why would any drug company ever lower their prices voluntarily anderson noted that the order did not provide details on the exact actions the administration could take against drugmakers who dont agree so the incentives are unclear the department of justice and federal trade commission will also take action against anticompetitive actions that keep prices high in the us white house officials said there will be an expectation that those prices should come down and then if they dont we will be looking at our various policy levers that can be used to force those prices down one official said we absolutely are going to get a better deal the order also directs the food and drug administration to consider expanding imports from other developed nations beyond canada trump signed a separate executive order in april directing the fda to improve the process by which states can apply to import lowercost drugs from canada among other actions intended to lower drug prices the trump administration claims that some drug prices will fall by up to almost immediately white house officials also said the administration will have a particular focus on drugs that have the largest disparities and largest expenditures which could include popular weight loss and diabetes treatments called glp drugs but experts cast doubts on whether the administration can cut prices significantly as its still unclear which drugs and nations will be targeted and whether other countries and drugmakers will comply we dont know the list of nations included said tricia neuman executive director for the program on medicare policy at kff a health policy research group their pricing would make a big difference in what our prices would be which could then affect access in the us in andersons view the order as written wont be effective at lowering drug prices its a great idea to pay international prices but its how you get to implement it there are no details and ability to effectuate it he said gostin also added that americans will likely not see lower prices in the foreseeable future still aarp which advocates for older americans thanked trump for issuing the order in a statement on monday its safe to say that we are excited about any attempts to help bring down prescription drug prices said leigh purvis the prescription drug policy principal in aarps public policy institute this approach is unusually understandable to the public because i think theres a general understanding that america does pay the highest prescription drug prices in the world she added that the devil is in the details and thats what were looking forward to seeing more of the pharmaceutical industry has argued that a most favored nation policy will hurt its profits and ability to research and develop new drugs last week phrma even that trumps proposal if applied to the medicaid program specifically could cost drugmakers as much as trillion over a decade but mondays executive order seems to be more of a headline risk than the sweeping shift for the pharmaceutical industry many had feared bmo capital markets analyst evan seigerman said in a note on monday he pointed to the uncertain path forward for the plan saying it could be more rhetoric than actual implementable policy seigerman added that trump appeared to be somewhat sympathetic to us manufacturers with the president arguing that european nations are not supporting drug research and development due to their lower prices anderson said the pharmaceutical industry may be breathing a sigh of relief today pending further details on what the administrations retaliatory actions could look like trumps order suggests that it is ultimately voluntary for drugmakers to lower prices and subsequently profits so he did not propose something that is mandatory and really has teeth here still while phrma agreed with trumps decision to target other countries the group emphasized that importing foreign prices from socialist countries would be a bad deal for american patients and workers it would mean less treatments and cures and would jeopardize the hundreds of billions our member companies are planning to invest in america threatening jobs hurting our economy and making us more reliant on china for innovative medicines the group said in a statement some analysts and experts said trump could alternatively implement his most favored nation policy through an existing tool to push down drug prices its a key provision of the biden administrations inflation reduction act that gives medicare the power to negotiate certain prescription drug prices with manufacturers the federal program is currently in its of talks with drugmakers the trump administration could use the most favored nation price for a given drug as the initial offer to manufacturers at the beginning of negotiations anderson said youd be starting the negotiation at an even lower price than they have in the past he said adding that it would not require any help from congress jpmorgan analysts added that we see a clearer pathway for the administration to implement the most favored nation policy at a smaller scale through medicare ira price negotiations where the impact would be limited to a small number of drugs and make the hit to drugmaker profits more gradual", "author": null, "publishedAt": "", "source": "", "url":

market that puts american patients first medicare director chris klomp said in a but wall street analysts are focused on another part of the guidance that could cause issues for and some other pharmaceutical companies the guidance document suggests that the trump administration could end a workaround that those companies are using to drag out revenue from topearning cancer drugs such as mercks keytruda and bristol myers squibbs opdivo the plan had been to shift patients to newer injectable or subcutaneous versions of their cancer drugs and keep charging medicare higher prices for them even after their original intravenous versions are subject to new negotiated prices under the program drugmakers have been banking on those subcutaneous versions as a way to dampen the revenue they would lose from medicare drug price negotiations along with upcoming patent expirations for the original forms of their drugs for example key patents for keytruda start expiring in under the current rules complex drugs known as biologics are eligible for the negotiation process after years but the clock restarts for a new version of the drug like a subcutaneous form that adds an additional active ingredient subcutaneous versions of drugs like opdivo are combination products that include an additional ingredient allowing them to be injected quickly instead of being slowly infused like the original intravenous form but on monday cms said it is soliciting comments on how it might consider grouping these combination drugs with their original versions if the added ingredient doesnt affect how the drug treats the underlying disease in other words the agency is considering whether to count two versions of a drug as a single product in certain cases that appears to be somewhat targeted at products such as subcutaneous keytruda and opdivo jpmorgan analysts said in a note on monday they said the guidance leads to at least the potential for inclusion of those

company said healthbench was developed alongside doctors from countries its based on conversations that simulate interactions between individual users or clinicians and ai models the discussions are split into seven different themes including global health emergency situations and handling uncertainty when a model responds to a prompt each response is graded against a set of physicianwritten rubric criteria specific to that conversation openai said healthbench contains unique rubric criteria openai included one example where a user said they found their yearold neighbor unresponsive on
