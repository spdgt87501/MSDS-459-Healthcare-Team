and that turned out to be a really effective way to gain traction she says and it now has nationwide insurance coverage with all the large insurance companies in the us they are not necessarily going

womens careers strober pointed to during the changemakers discussion found that at the midcareer moment when women should be gaining their greatest successes in the workplace the shift into menopause can hold them back strober said the growing body of research details how menopause can result in discrimination at work with women quitting jobs or not going for raises or promotions because of symptoms and also because they dont believe they can get the treatment that they need if you believe that you have something that cant be fixed its very embarrassing and that means people step back

marketed and the reality she experienced the pictureperfect image of parenting was overwhelming for a new parent she said there was a big dichotomy between the content i was consuming and the frontline experience at am hirschhorn says there was no data available at the time to substantiate what she felt because the topic was understudied and underfunded so she took on the category of infant health and wellness for whatever reason hirschhorn says she had the conviction to think i could fix this while there is a distinction between the health challenges the two female ceo and founders focus on not every woman will become pregnant but all will go through menopause one big idea binds the two women leaders together products treatments and services exist that can meet critical needs in an underserved and undervalued market we have this idea that perimenopause is at a certain time and people think they have to suffer for a really long time before they get the right care but what we say is you dont have to suffer at all strober shared at the changemakers summit as soon as youre in your s and anything starts feeling wrong you should get help the idea of suffering is really outdated she said women have been trained to suffer for far too long and were both named to the actress and entrepreneur who has become a leading advocate for menopause health as founder and chief creative officer at stripes beauty after struggling with early menopause at the height of her early hollywood fame was also among the changemakers at the changemakers summit on april the two women ceos shared advice and lessons from their successes bringing new business ideas to health care here are a few of the key themes they touched on in a discussion with cnbcs kate rooney in addition to the dearth of information that exists to prepare women for the reality of parenthood educational content for women has been censored when on topics related to reproductive health that was something that hirschhorn learned once she started frida a time when it was almost impossible she says to find authentic storytelling on the subject matter and led her to create sixty percent of womens health ads content or content in general has been in some way shape or form rejected or filtered she said thats not just online but on linear television part of what hirschhorn calls a very gendered dichotomy citing the fact that male health and sexual wellness content is approved at a significantly higher rate that leaves her incredulous she said and it is a call to action to shift from womens health being a topic of provocation to a topic of public health women have to advocate for themselves she said women cant be complacent and this goes beyond health care this can drive real change in retail in every facet of life she added strober noted that when she was building midi health it became clear that a major challenge would be working with codes created by the insurance industry for menopause in effect another form of institutional censorship midi health decided to position itself as an innetwork primary care provider that had a specialty in menopause and that turned out to be a really effective way to gain traction she says and it now has nationwide insurance coverage with all the large insurance companies in the us they are not necessarily going to cover sexual health issues but they will cover primary care so you just subsume it she explained by viewing menopause as just part of womens health she says the company was able to create a reimbursement mechanism that meets insurance standards that insurance coverage is a very big deal because research is showing that lack of menopause treatment can have a high cost when it comes to womens careers strober pointed to during the changemakers discussion found that at the midcareer moment when women should be gaining their greatest successes in the workplace the shift into menopause can hold them back strober said the growing body of research details how menopause can result in discrimination at work with women quitting jobs or not going for raises or promotions because of symptoms and also because they dont believe they can get the treatment that they need if you believe that you have something that cant be fixed its very embarrassing and that means people step back from what they are doing strober said they are scared she added that can be the experience that is called brain fog and also hot flashes you lose power during hot flashes strober said people are not as confident but if you are getting treated for it its just a hot flash and you can regain power she added hirschhorn says that by the numbers there is still huge potential in the womens health market it is estimated to grow to billion by according to data she cited at the event and that is despite the fact that less than of healthcare rd spending and investment goes to the category a seismic gap she said it is a wellknown fact in consumer research that women dominate household spending but hirschhorn said in fridas market there is a viral opportunity that is underappreciated creating products for women based on real need creates a virality that is hard to recreate with other demographics she said these women arent just buying their products they are selling them to their communities and friends we call that word of mom hirschhorn said its a really big untapped opportunity she added as a former venture investor strober said it is important to accept that people are not dying to invest in womens health but she added that when you can show the growth that companies like midi health are posting that wont slow a company down we are the fastestgrowing digital health company probably ever quite honestly she said we are growing insanely fast because women really need access to this care and cant get it elsewhere she added similar to the virality experienced by frida strober says the business model does build on itself once you take care of one thing for women they come back to you for something else and if you develop this trusted platform for them where they become your longterm patient that is a good business she said we dont say its a womens business we say its a really good business she added that opportunity and the unfiltered realities of parenthood have now grown frida to more than products covering everything from conception to postpartum and breastfeeding care and beyond my four children are a hotbed of inspiration and my snot sucking days are almost over hirschhorn said but she added the same problems exist you just need a different toolkit at midi health strober says the next big opportunity to unlock is making connections between menopause health and longevity if you take care of yourself in your s you can really prevent a lot of the diseases that come in your s and so we have been thinking a lot about this longevity market strober said its all bros all the bros who are out there and talking about wanting to live to we just want to take care of ourselves we dont care about living to we just want to be healthy grandmas she said what do we do how do we take care of our brains and bones and hearts to age in a healthy way strober asks she says there are many treatments products and services yet to be developed by health companies that will help women in their s s and s to better answer that question"}

the key themes they touched on in a discussion with cnbcs kate rooney in addition to the dearth of information that exists to prepare women for the reality of parenthood educational content for women has been censored when on topics related to reproductive health that was something that hirschhorn learned once she started frida a time when it was almost impossible she says to find authentic

and that turned out to be a really effective way to gain traction she says and it now has nationwide insurance coverage with all the large insurance companies in the us they are not necessarily going

womens careers strober pointed to during the changemakers discussion found that at the midcareer moment when women should be gaining their greatest successes in the workplace the shift into menopause can hold them back strober said the growing body of research details how menopause can result in discrimination at work with women quitting jobs or not going for raises or promotions because of symptoms and also because they dont believe they can get the treatment that they need if you believe that you have something that cant be fixed its very embarrassing and that means people step back from what they are doing strober said they are scared she added that can be the experience that is called brain fog and also hot flashes you lose power during hot flashes strober said people are not

infant health and wellness for whatever reason hirschhorn says she had the conviction to think i could fix this while there is a distinction between the health challenges the two female ceo and founders focus on not every woman will become pregnant but all will go through menopause one big idea binds the two women leaders together products treatments and services exist that can meet critical needs in an underserved and undervalued market we have this idea that perimenopause is at a certain time and people think they have to suffer for a really long time before they get the right care but what we say is you dont have to suffer at all strober shared at the changemakers summit as soon as youre in your s and anything starts feeling wrong you should get help the idea of suffering is really outdated she said women have been trained to suffer for far too long and were both named to the actress and entrepreneur who has become a leading advocate for menopause health as founder and chief creative officer at stripes beauty after struggling with early menopause at the height of her early hollywood fame was also among the changemakers at the changemakers summit on april the two women ceos shared advice and lessons from their successes bringing new business ideas to health care here are a few of the key themes they touched on in a discussion with cnbcs kate rooney in addition to the dearth of information that exists to prepare women for the reality of parenthood educational content for women has been censored when on topics related to reproductive health that was something that hirschhorn learned once she started frida a time when it was almost impossible she says to find authentic storytelling on the subject matter and led her to create sixty percent of womens health ads content or content in general has been in some way shape or form rejected or filtered she said thats not just online but on linear television part of what hirschhorn calls a very gendered dichotomy citing the fact that male health and sexual wellness content is approved at a significantly higher rate that leaves her incredulous she said and it is a call to action to shift from womens health being a topic of provocation to a topic of public health women have to advocate for themselves she said women cant be complacent and this goes beyond health care this can drive real change in retail in every facet of life she added strober noted that when she was building midi health it became clear that a major challenge would be working with codes created by the insurance industry for menopause in effect another form of institutional censorship midi health decided to position itself as an innetwork primary care provider that had a specialty in menopause and that turned out to be a really effective way to gain traction she says and it now has nationwide insurance coverage with all the large insurance companies in the us they are not necessarily going to cover sexual health issues but they will cover primary care so you just subsume it she explained by viewing menopause as just part of womens health she says the company was able to create a reimbursement mechanism that meets insurance standards that insurance coverage is a very big deal because research is showing that lack of menopause treatment can have a high cost when it comes to womens careers strober pointed to during the changemakers discussion found that at the midcareer moment when women should be gaining their greatest successes in the workplace the shift into menopause can hold them back strober said the growing body of research details how menopause can result in discrimination at work with women quitting jobs or not going for raises or promotions because of symptoms and also because they dont believe they can get the treatment that they need if you believe that you have something that cant be fixed its very embarrassing and that means people step back from what they are doing strober said they are scared she added that can be the experience that is called brain fog and also hot flashes you lose power during hot flashes strober said people are not as confident but if you are getting treated for it its just a hot flash and you can regain power she added hirschhorn says that by the numbers there is still huge potential in the womens health market it is estimated to grow to billion by according to data she cited at the event and that is despite the fact that less than of healthcare rd spending and investment goes to the category a seismic gap she said it is a wellknown fact in consumer research that women dominate household spending but hirschhorn said in fridas market there is a viral opportunity that is underappreciated creating products for women based on real need creates a virality that is hard to recreate with other demographics she said these women arent just buying their products they are selling them to their communities and friends we call that word of mom hirschhorn said its a really big untapped opportunity she added as a former venture investor strober said it is important to accept that people are not dying to invest in womens health but she added that when you can show the growth that companies like midi health are posting that wont slow a company down we are the fastestgrowing digital health company probably ever quite honestly she said we are growing insanely fast because women really need access to this care and cant get it elsewhere she added similar to the virality experienced by frida strober says the business model does build on itself once you take care of one thing for women they come back to you for something else and if you develop this trusted platform for them where they become your longterm patient that is a good business she said we dont say its a womens business we say its a really good business she added that opportunity and the unfiltered realities of parenthood have now grown frida to more than products covering everything from conception to postpartum and breastfeeding care and beyond my four children are a hotbed of inspiration and my snot sucking days are almost over hirschhorn said but she added the same problems exist you just need a different toolkit at midi health strober says the next big opportunity to unlock is making connections between menopause health and longevity if you take care of yourself in your s you can really prevent a lot of the diseases that come in your s and so we have been thinking a lot about this longevity market strober said its all bros all the bros who are out there and talking about wanting to live to we just want to take care of ourselves we dont care about living to we just want to be healthy grandmas she said what do we do how do we take care of our brains and bones and hearts to age in a healthy way strober asks she says there are many treatments products and services yet to be developed by health companies that will help women in their s s and s to better answer that question"}

costs with the first phase of the effort slated to deliver billion in savings by the end of with the added cuts announced tuesday pfizer now expects to deliver around billion in savings by the end of that year from the two costcutting efforts the cuts aim to help the pharmaceutical giant recover from the rapid decline of its covid business and stock price over the last few years and appear to be paying off heres what the company reported for the compared with what wall street was expecting based on a survey of analysts by lseg the results come as drugmakers brace for president s planned tariffs on pharmaceuticals imported into the us his administrations bid to boost us manufacturing of medications unlike other companies grappling with evolving trade policy pfizer did not revise its outlook the company maintained its fullyear outlook forecasting sales of billion to billion with a similar performance from its covid products as seen in however pfizer noted in its earnings release that the guidance does not currently include any potential impact related to future tariffs and trade policy changes which we are unable to predict at this time but on the earnings call on tuesday pfizer executives said the guidance does reflect million in costs from trumps existing tariffs included in our guidance that we didnt really speak about is there are some tariffs in place today pfizer cfo dave denton said on the call we are contemplating that within our guidance range and we continue to again trend to the top end of our guidance range even with those costs to be incurred this year he said on the call pfizer ceo albert bourla said the company established a team to analyze a range of potential outcomes and develop strategies to help mitigate the potential impact of tariffs on its business in the short and long term that team is managing current inventory levels in certain jurisdictions and leveraging pfizers domestic manufacturing footprint among other efforts should we be impacted by further tariffs in the future we will assess the impact of the policies enacted and provide information at the appropriate time bourla said he added that uncertainty around trumps pharmaceutical tariffs is deterring the company from further investing in us manufacturing and research and development pfizer still expects that resulting from the inflation reduction act will hurt sales by billion dampening growth by approximately compared with stripping out onetime items the company expects earnings to be in the range of to a share with the underlying strength of our business we believe we can be agile in navigating an uncertain and volatile external environment bourla said in a release for the first quarter the company booked net income of billion or cents per share that compares with net income of billion or cents per share during the same period a year ago excluding certain items including restructuring charges and costs associated with intangible assets the company posted earnings per share of cents for the quarter pfizer reported revenue of billion for the first quarter down from the same period a year ago the company said the decrease in sales was primarily driven by a decline in revenue for paxlovid which posted million in sales during the first quarter down from the same period a year ago in part due to lower covid infections worldwide and reduced international government purchases of the drug the drop in sales also reflects a boost pfizer got in the first quarter of from a final adjustment related to a previously recorded revenue reversal for paxlovid analysts had expected paxlovid to generate million in sales for the first quarter according to streetaccount estimates meanwhile the companys covid shot comirnaty booked million in revenue up from the same period a year ago thats above the million that analysts were expecting according to streetaccount the results come as shot makers like pfizer face uncertainty over immunization policy and regulation under robert f kennedy jr a prominent vaccine skeptic who now oversees the nations federal health agencies as secretary of the department of health and human services kennedy has pursued a sweeping overhaul of different agencies cutting staff consolidating or eliminating offices and taking actions that could ultimately undermine vaccines"}

study finds  the growing demand for diabetes and weight loss drugs like mounjaro ozempic and wegovy has helped fuel higher health costs for large employers for many the big question is whether the pricey medications known as glps will pay off by improving worker health and lowering overall health costs over time analysts at aon say its already happening weve never seen anything like this really said greg case ceo of an employer benefits services firm there was a reduction in major cardiovascular issues there was substantial reduction in osteoporosis there was substantial reduction in pneumonia of multiple types aon researchers found that within two years patients taking glp drugs saw improved health outcomes which significantly slowed the growth rate of their medical costs the rate of growth known as the medical cost trend was cut roughly in half the researchers said glps come at a list price of more than per dose as broader approval for the drugs spurs higher demand its also causing employer drug spending to spike since glps have pushed costs up at a faster pace than highpriced specialty medications which include costly cancer and autoimmune treatments by evernorth a division of aon analysts looked at medical claims data for usbased workers with employer health coverage who took glp medications between and beyond the drug costs the study found glp patients tend to incur higher medical costs in their first year on the drugs with more doctor visits to monitor their treatment on the drug and to seek help for other issues such as sleep apnea and esophageal conditions like acid reflux the increase comes about in the first to months case said theyre getting remedies on things that actually are underlying conditions of obesity but by the end of the second year of treatment with the glp drugs the medical cost trend for patients taking them slowed by on average compared to workers with similar chronic conditions and obesity characteristics who were not taking the drugs aon found for those not taking the drug the medical cost trend was the biggest driver of those savings was the reduction by more than of major adverse cardiac events such as heart attacks and strokes compared with patients who were not taking the drugs as well as a reduction in the onset of diabetes case said with this data aon has been able to help clients understand the timeline for seeing a return on providing insurance coverage for glps for weight loss in addition to type diabetes we saw every single place where the cost went down and its stunning said case you can

mounjaro ozempic and wegovy has helped fuel higher health costs for large employers for many the big question is whether the pricey medications known as glps will pay off by improving worker health and lowering overall health costs over time analysts at aon say its already happening weve never seen anything like this really said greg case ceo of an employer benefits services firm there was a reduction in major cardiovascular issues there was substantial reduction in osteoporosis there was substantial reduction in pneumonia of multiple types aon researchers found that within two years patients taking glp drugs saw improved health outcomes which significantly slowed the growth rate of their medical costs the rate of growth known as the medical cost trend was cut roughly in half the researchers said glps come at a list price of more than per dose as broader approval for the drugs spurs higher demand its also causing employer drug spending to spike since glps have pushed costs up at a faster pace than highpriced specialty medications which include costly cancer and autoimmune treatments by evernorth a division of aon analysts looked at medical claims data for usbased workers with employer health coverage who took glp medications between and beyond the drug costs the study found glp patients tend to incur higher medical costs in their first year on the drugs with more doctor visits to monitor their treatment on the drug and to seek help for other issues such as sleep apnea and esophageal conditions like acid reflux the increase comes about in the first to months case said theyre getting remedies on things that actually are underlying conditions of obesity but by the end of the second year of treatment with the glp drugs the medical cost trend for patients taking them slowed by on average compared to workers with similar chronic conditions and obesity characteristics who were not taking the drugs aon found for those not taking the drug the medical cost trend was the biggest driver of those savings was the reduction by more than of major adverse cardiac events such as heart attacks and strokes compared with patients who were not taking the drugs as well as a reduction in the onset of diabetes case said with this data aon has been able to help clients understand the timeline for seeing a return on providing insurance coverage for glps for weight loss in addition to type diabetes we saw every single place where the cost went down and its stunning said case you can do this in a way that has an roi that will literally be an economic return

posted earnings per share of cents for the quarter pfizer reported revenue of billion for the first quarter down from the same period a year ago the company said the decrease in sales was primarily driven by a decline in revenue for paxlovid which posted million in sales during the first quarter down from the same period a year ago in part due to lower covid infections worldwide and reduced international government purchases of the drug the drop in sales also reflects a boost pfizer got in the first quarter of from a final adjustment related to a previously recorded revenue reversal for paxlovid analysts had expected paxlovid to generate million in sales for the first quarter according to streetaccount estimates meanwhile the companys covid shot comirnaty booked million in revenue up from the same period a year ago thats above the million that analysts were expecting according to streetaccount the results come as shot makers like pfizer face uncertainty over immunization policy

were in need older generic drugs account for about prescribed in the us many are critical for hospital care including antibiotics and vasopressors or medications that raise blood pressure ricks noted that those essential drugs are not easy to make but theyre cheap and theyve been driven out of our country due to cost and other damaging policies however some health experts previously told cnbc that tariffs on generic drugs which have far lower profit margins than branded medications could force some generic drugmakers to leave the us market altogether that could lead to or exacerbate shortages of certain generic drugs in the us such as sterile injectable drugs commonly used in hospitals ricks comments come as drugmakers brace for president s planned pharmaceutical tariffs which aim to boost domestic manufacturing those tariff threats are already of us manufacturing investments from the pharmaceutical industry that includes eli lilly which in february announced it will to build four new production sites in the us on thursday ricks said tariffs may not be needed after the industrys moves to reshore manufacturing i think that actually the threat of tariffs is already bringing back critical supply chains into important industries chips and pharma ricks said so do we need to enact tariffs im not so sure he added that eli lilly wants to see permanent lower tax rates in the us particularly for domestic production ricks said lower taxes drove many drugmakers to manufacture in lowtax islands like ireland singapore and in switzerland and that can come back if theres an economic incentive that echoes the sentiment of pfizer ceo albert bourlas on tuesday though bourla argued that uncertainty around tariffs is deterring the company from making us investments in manufacturing and research and development"}

the us by eliminating unnecessary requirements streamlining reviews and working with domestic drugmakers to provide early support before facilities come online according to it also directs the agency to raise inspection fees for foreign manufacturing plants improve the enforcement of activeingredient source reporting by overseas producers and consider publicly listing facilities that dont comply the white house estimates that it can currently take five to years to build new manufacturing capacity for pharmaceuticals which it called unacceptable from a nationalsecurity standpoint we dont want to be buying our pharmaceuticals from other countries because if were in a war were in a problem we want to be able to make our own trump said in the fact sheet as we invest in the future we will permanently bring our medical supply chains back home we will produce our medical supplies pharmaceuticals and treatments right here in the united states the order will allow the fda to conduct more inspections of new manufacturing sites with the same resources the agencys commissioner marty makary told reporters on monday the fda will also ramp up inspections of foreign drug facilities switching from announced to surprise visits overseas he said we had this crazy system in the united states where american pharma manufacturers are put through the ringer with inspections and the foreign sites get a lot easier with scheduled visits while we have surprise visits makary said trumps order also directs the environmental protection agency to accelerate the construction of facilities related to manufacturing drugs and their ingredients and it ensures that federal agencies issuing permits for a domestic pharmaceutical manufacturing facility designate a single pointofcontact to coordinate applications along with support from the white house office of management and budget the order comes ahead of trumps planned tariffs on pharmaceuticals imported into the us those potential levies and efforts to build goodwill with the president have already from drugmakers such as and trump on monday told reporters he will announce pharmaceuticalspecific tariffs within the next two weeks his

development and manufacturing us manufacturing in the pharmaceutical industry has shrunk significantly in recent decades production of most of the socalled active ingredients in medicines has moved to china and other countries largely due to lower costs for labor and other parts of the process according to the the us imported billion in pharmaceutical products in alone with coming from europe primarily ireland germany and switzerland according to conducted by consulting firm ey reshoring manufacturing can help make the drug supply chain more robust decreasing the risk of disruptions

doubles down on robots to fill prescriptions amid turnaround push  as work to regain their footing is doubling down on the company is expanding the number of retail stores served by its microfulfillment centers which use robots to fill thousands of prescriptions for patients who take medications to manage or treat diabetes high blood pressure and other conditions walgreens aims to free up time for pharmacy staff reducing their routine tasks and eliminating inventory waste fewer prescription fills would allow employees to interact directly with patients and perform more clinical services such as vaccinations and testing walgreens first rolled out the robotpowered centers in but paused expansion in to focus on gathering feedback and improving performance at existing sites after more than a year of making upgrades including new internal tools the company said it is ready to expand the reach of that technology again walgreens told cnbc it hopes to have its microfulfillment centers serve more than stores by the end of the year up from in february and in october as of february the centers handled of the prescription volume on average at supported pharmacies according to walgreens that translates to around million prescriptions filled each month across the different sites the company said the renewed automation push comes as walgreens prepares to go private in a roughly with sycamore partners expected to close by the end of the year the deal would cap a turbulent chapter for walgreens as a public company marked by a rocky transition out of the pandemic declining pharmacy reimbursement rates weaker consumer spending and fierce competition from and other retail giants like cvs walgreens has shifted from opening new stores to closing hundreds of underperforming locations to shore up profits both companies are racing to stay relevant as online retailers lure away customers and patients increasingly opt for fast home delivery over traditional pharmacy visits the changes also follow mounting discontent among pharmacy staff in nationwide walkouts spotlighted burnout and chronic understaffing forcing chains to reexamine their operational models walgreens said the investment in robotic pharmacy fills is already paying off to date microfulfillment centers have generated approximately million in savings by cutting excess inventory and boosting efficiency said kayla heffington walgreens pharmacy operating model vice president heffington added that stores using the facilities are administering more vaccines than those that arent right now theyre the backbone to really help us offset some of the workload in our stores to obviously allow more time for our pharmacists and technicians to spend time with patients said rick gates walgreens chief pharmacy officer it gives us a lot more flexibility to bring down costs to increase the care and increase speed to therapy all those things he said gates added that the centers give walgreens a competitive advantage because independent pharmacies and some rivals dont have centralized support for their stores still and have similarly tested or their own microfulfillment facilities to dispense grocery items and other prescriptions microfulfillment centers come with their own risks such as a heavy reliance on sophisticated robotics that can cause disruptions if errors occur but the facilities are becoming a permanent fixture in retail due to the cost savings they offer and their ability to streamline workflows reduce the burden on employees and deliver goods to customers faster when a walgreens retail pharmacy receives a prescription the system determines whether it should be filled at that location or routed to a nearby microfulfillment center maintenance medications or prescription drugs taken regularly to manage chronic health conditions and refills that dont require immediate pickup are often sent to microfulfillment at the core of each facility is a highly automated system that uses robotics conveyor belts and barcode scanners among other tools to fill prescriptions the operations are supported by a team of pharmacists pharmacy technicians and other professionals instead of staff members filling prescriptions by hand at stores pill bottles move through an automated and carefully choreographed assembly line pharmacy technicians fill canisters with medications for robot pods to dispense and pharmacists verify those canisters to make sure they are accurate yellow robotic arms grab a labeled prescription vial and hold it up to a canister which precisely dispenses the specific medication for that bottle certain prescriptions are filled at separate manual stations including inhalers and birth control pill packs each prescription is then sorted and packaged for delivery back to retail pharmacy locations for final pickup there are other security and safety measures throughout the process said ahlam antar registered group supervisor of a microfulfillment center in mansfield massachusetts for example the robot pods automatically lock and signal an error with a redorange light if a worker attaches a canister to the wrong dispenser preventing the incorrect pills from going in a prescription she said properly training workers at the centers to ensure accuracy and patient safety is also crucial according to sarah gonsalves a senior certified pharmacy technician at the mansfield site she said a core part of her role is to make sure that technicians can correctly perform the different tasks in the process antar who has worked at the mansfield site since its opening said walgreens has made improvements to the microfulfillment process after considering feedback from stores and patients during the paused expansion that includes establishing new roles needed to support the process at the sites such as a training manager for all locations the facilities also plan to transition to using smaller prescription vials after hearing concerns that the current bottles are too large according to a walgreens spokesperson they said that will allow the centers to ship more prescriptions per order and reduce costs heffington said the automated locations have helped reduce walgreens overall prescription fulfillment costs by nearly compared to a year ago she said walgreens has also increased prescription volume by yearoveryear now filling more than million prescriptions annually the company hopes to raise that number to million or even more heffington added that walgreens implemented new internal tools to track the work across all centers and provide realtime data on where a patients prescription is in the microfulfillment process if a patient called the store and said hey can you tell me where my prescription is today workers can do that with great specificity thanks to the new tools heffington said despite the companys progress gates said there is more work to be done with microfulfillment centers for example he pointed to the possibility of shipping prescriptions directly to patients doorsteps instead of putting that burden on retail stores its only step one right now he said other improvements may still be needed at facilities according to some reports for example wral news in april that some customers at a walgreens store in garner north carolina say they are only getting partial prescription fills with several pills missing or their medicine is being delayed before brian ganges arizona store started relying on an automated facility he walked into the pharmacy every morning knowing that a massive list of prescriptions was in his work queue waiting to be filled for the day now with help from microfulfillment that list is significantly smaller each day according to gange we dont have to spend as much time on just those repetitive fulfillment tasks he told cnbc it really takes a huge weight off our shoulders gange said that gives him and his team time to step behind the pharmacy counter and interact with customers facetoface answering questions providing advice performing health tests or administering vaccines that kind of attention can make all the difference for a patient for example gange recalls stepping away for five minutes to take a patients blood pressure despite being overwhelmed with tasks while working at a different walgreens location several years ago he ended up sending that person to the emergency room because their blood pressure was off the charts that patients wife visited the pharmacy the next day to thank gange saying her husband probably wouldnt be here with us today without that blood pressure test i shouldnt have to question whether i have that five or minutes to check a blood pressure for a patient gange said microfulfillment and centralized services are really what are going to allow us to be able to do that to have that time that really allows us to provide better care for them he added"}],

employees to interact directly with patients and perform more clinical services such as vaccinations and testing walgreens first rolled out the robotpowered centers in but paused expansion in to focus on gathering feedback and improving performance at existing sites after more than a year of making upgrades including new internal tools the company said it is ready to expand the reach of that technology again walgreens told cnbc it hopes to have its microfulfillment centers serve more than stores by the end of the year up from in february and in october as of february the centers handled of the prescription volume on average at supported pharmacies according to walgreens that translates to around million prescriptions filled each month across the different sites the company said the renewed automation push comes as walgreens prepares to go private in a roughly with sycamore partners expected to close by the end of the year the deal would cap a turbulent chapter for walgreens as a public company marked by a rocky transition out of the pandemic declining pharmacy reimbursement rates weaker consumer spending and fierce competition from and other retail giants like cvs walgreens has shifted from opening new stores to closing hundreds of underperforming locations to shore up profits both companies are racing to stay relevant as online retailers lure away customers and patients increasingly opt for fast home delivery over traditional pharmacy visits the changes also follow mounting discontent among pharmacy staff in nationwide walkouts spotlighted burnout and chronic understaffing forcing chains to reexamine their operational models walgreens said the investment in robotic pharmacy fills is already paying off to date microfulfillment centers have generated approximately million in savings by cutting excess inventory and boosting efficiency said kayla heffington walgreens pharmacy operating model vice president heffington added that stores using the facilities are administering more vaccines than those that arent right now theyre the backbone to really help us offset some of the workload in our stores to obviously allow more time for our pharmacists and technicians to spend time with patients said rick gates walgreens chief pharmacy officer it gives us a lot more flexibility to bring down costs to increase the care and increase speed to therapy all those things he said gates added that the centers give walgreens a competitive advantage because independent pharmacies and some rivals dont have centralized support for their stores still and have similarly tested or their own microfulfillment facilities to dispense grocery items and other prescriptions microfulfillment centers come with their own risks such as a heavy reliance on sophisticated robotics that can cause disruptions if errors occur but the facilities are becoming a permanent fixture in retail due to the cost savings they offer and their ability to streamline workflows reduce the burden on employees and deliver goods to customers faster when a walgreens retail pharmacy receives a prescription the system determines whether it should be filled at that location or routed to a nearby microfulfillment center maintenance medications or prescription drugs taken regularly to manage chronic health conditions and refills that dont require immediate pickup are often sent to microfulfillment at the core of each facility is a highly automated system that uses robotics conveyor belts and barcode scanners among other tools to fill prescriptions the operations are supported by a team of pharmacists pharmacy technicians and other professionals instead of staff members filling prescriptions by hand at stores pill bottles move through an automated and carefully choreographed assembly line pharmacy technicians fill canisters with medications for robot pods to dispense and pharmacists verify those canisters to make sure they are accurate yellow robotic arms grab a labeled prescription vial and hold it up to a canister which precisely dispenses the specific medication for that bottle certain prescriptions are filled at separate manual stations including inhalers and birth control pill packs each prescription is then sorted and packaged for delivery back to retail pharmacy locations for final pickup there are other security and safety measures throughout the process said ahlam antar registered group supervisor of a microfulfillment center in mansfield massachusetts for example the robot pods automatically lock and signal an error with a redorange light if a worker attaches a canister to the wrong dispenser preventing the incorrect pills from going in a prescription she said properly training workers at the centers to ensure accuracy and patient safety is also crucial according to sarah gonsalves a senior certified pharmacy technician at the mansfield site she said a core part of her role is to make sure that technicians can correctly perform the different tasks in the process antar who has worked at the mansfield site since its opening said walgreens has made improvements to the microfulfillment process after considering feedback from stores and patients during the paused expansion that includes establishing new roles needed to support the process at the sites such as a training manager for all locations the facilities also plan to transition to using smaller prescription vials after hearing concerns that the current bottles are too large according to a walgreens spokesperson they said that will allow the centers to ship more prescriptions per order and reduce costs heffington said the automated locations have helped reduce walgreens overall prescription fulfillment costs by nearly compared to a year ago she said walgreens has also increased prescription volume by yearoveryear now filling more than million prescriptions annually the company hopes to raise that number to million or even more heffington added that walgreens implemented new internal tools to track the work across all centers and provide realtime data on where a patients prescription is in the microfulfillment process if a patient called the store and said hey can you tell me where my prescription is today workers can do that with great specificity thanks to the new tools heffington said despite the companys progress gates said there is more work to be done with microfulfillment centers for example he pointed to the possibility of shipping prescriptions directly to patients doorsteps instead of putting that burden on retail stores its only step one right now he said other improvements may still be needed at facilities according to some reports for example wral news in april that some customers at a walgreens store in garner north carolina say they are only getting partial prescription fills with several pills missing or their medicine is being delayed before brian ganges arizona store started relying on an automated facility he walked into the pharmacy every morning knowing that a massive list of prescriptions was in his work queue waiting to be filled for the day now with help from microfulfillment that list is significantly smaller each day according to gange we dont have to spend as much time on just those repetitive fulfillment tasks he told cnbc it really takes a huge weight off our shoulders gange said that gives him and his team time to step behind the pharmacy counter and interact with customers facetoface answering questions providing advice performing health tests or administering vaccines that kind of attention can make all the difference for a patient for example gange recalls stepping away for five minutes to take a patients blood pressure despite being overwhelmed with tasks while working at a different walgreens location several years ago he ended up sending that person to the emergency room because their blood pressure was off the charts that patients wife visited the pharmacy the next day to thank gange saying her husband probably wouldnt be here with us today without that blood pressure test i shouldnt have to question whether i have that five or minutes to check a blood pressure for a patient gange said microfulfillment and centralized services are really what are going to allow us to be able to do that to have that time that really allows us to provide better care for them he added"}

they raised doubts about whether other nations and drugmakers will do what trump hopes to accomplish with the order were unlikely to get the drug companies to voluntarily decrease their prices and were not going to get the other countries to voluntarily increase their prices right said gerard anderson professor of health policy and management at the johns hopkins bloomberg school of public health trumps order takes aim in part at other countries many of which have singlepayer health systems with more leverage to negotiate down drug prices with manufacturers in contrast the us has a patchwork of public and private insurance and partly relies on middlemen to set prices the presidents policy directs the office of the us trade representative and the department of commerce to fight what the administration called unreasonable and discriminatory policies in foreign countries that unfairly undercut market prices and drive price hikes in the united states in a statement on monday the pharmaceutical industrys biggest lobbying group phrma lauded trump for taking aim at other nations for what they deemed not paying their fair share but other countries governments are simply negotiating within the limits of their national health budgets not using unfair methods like trump claims said lawrence gostin a professor of public health law at georgetown university he added that they are securing fair prices for their own countries which has nothing to do with undercutting the us its unclear what actions the us could take to force other nations to take action but anderson said there is currently no incentive for them to hike their prices they have a system that works for them and they get lower prices countries like france and switzerland are all not going to sit there and say hey now i want to pay more he said the pharmaceutical industry would likely want to to see price hikes in countries within the european union before it voluntarily lowers any drug prices in the us jpmorgan analysts said that makes other pieces of the executive order appear unlikely to come to pass trumps order directs the health and human services secretary to establish a way for us patients to buy their drugs directly from manufacturers at most favored nation prices cutting out middlemen the order mentions directtoconsumer purchasing programs without further details his plan also calls for hhs secretary robert f kennedy jr to give drugmakers price reduction targets within the next days which will open up negotiations with the companies if adequate progress is not made toward those goals within six months of the order being signed hhs will impose most favored nation pricing on drugs through rulemaking or other aggressive measures according to the order but anderson said it would likely take far longer for the government and drugmakers to agree on a price under a provision of the inflation reduction act medicare and drug manufacturers typically take six months to a year to negotiate prices he added why would any drug company ever lower their prices voluntarily anderson noted that the order did not provide details on the exact actions the administration could take against drugmakers who dont agree so the incentives are unclear the department of justice and federal trade commission will also take action against anticompetitive actions that keep prices high in the us white house officials said there will be an expectation that those prices should come down and then if they dont we will be looking at our various policy levers that can be used to force those prices down one official said we absolutely are going to get a better deal the order also directs the food and drug administration to consider expanding imports from other developed nations beyond canada trump signed a separate executive order in april directing the fda to improve the process by which states can apply to import lowercost drugs from canada among other actions intended to lower drug prices the trump administration claims that some drug prices will fall by up to almost immediately white house officials also said the administration will have a particular focus on drugs that have the largest disparities and largest expenditures which could include popular weight loss and diabetes treatments called glp drugs but experts cast doubts on whether the administration can cut prices significantly as its still unclear which drugs and nations will be targeted and whether other countries and drugmakers will comply we dont know the list of nations included said tricia neuman executive director for the program on medicare policy at kff a health policy research group their pricing would make a big difference in what our prices would be which could then affect access in the us in andersons view the order as written wont be effective at lowering drug prices its a great idea to pay international prices but its how you get to implement it there are no details and ability to effectuate it he said gostin also added that americans will likely not see lower prices in the foreseeable future still aarp which advocates for older americans thanked trump for issuing the order in a statement on monday its safe to say that we are excited about any attempts to help bring down prescription drug prices said leigh purvis the prescription drug policy principal in aarps public policy institute this approach is unusually understandable to the public because i think theres a general understanding that america does pay the highest prescription drug prices in the world she added that the devil is in the details and thats what were looking forward to seeing more of the pharmaceutical industry has argued that a most favored nation policy will hurt its profits and ability to research and develop new drugs last week phrma even that trumps proposal if applied to the medicaid program specifically could cost drugmakers as much as trillion over a decade but mondays executive order seems to be more of a headline risk than the sweeping shift for the pharmaceutical industry many had feared bmo capital markets analyst evan seigerman said in a note on monday he pointed to the uncertain path forward for the plan saying it could be more rhetoric than actual implementable policy seigerman added that trump appeared to be somewhat sympathetic to us manufacturers with the president arguing that european nations are not supporting drug research and development due to their lower prices anderson said the pharmaceutical industry may be breathing a sigh of relief today pending further details on what the administrations retaliatory actions could look like trumps order suggests that it is ultimately voluntary for drugmakers to lower prices and subsequently profits so he did not propose something that is mandatory and really has teeth here still while phrma agreed with trumps decision to target other countries the group emphasized that importing foreign prices from socialist countries would be a bad deal for american patients and workers it would mean less treatments and cures and would jeopardize the hundreds of billions our member companies are planning to invest in america threatening jobs hurting our economy and making us more reliant on china for innovative medicines the group said in a statement some analysts and experts said trump could alternatively implement his most favored nation policy through an existing tool to push down drug prices its a key provision of the biden administrations inflation reduction act that gives medicare the power to negotiate certain prescription drug prices with manufacturers the federal program is currently in its of talks with drugmakers the trump administration could use the most favored nation price for a given drug as the initial offer to manufacturers at the beginning of negotiations anderson said youd be starting the negotiation at an even lower price than they have in the past he said adding that it would not require any help from congress jpmorgan analysts added that we see a clearer pathway for the administration to implement the most favored nation policy at a smaller scale

drugmakers notably several republican lawmakers opposed including a most favored nation provision in the major economic policy bill they plan to pass in the coming months the road ahead could be muddy the analysts wrote in a note while experts backed the idea of lowering prices they raised doubts about whether other nations and drugmakers will do what trump hopes to accomplish with the order were unlikely to get the drug companies to voluntarily decrease their prices and were not going to get the other countries to voluntarily increase their prices right said gerard anderson professor of health policy and management at the johns hopkins bloomberg school of public health trumps order takes aim in part at other countries many of which have singlepayer health systems with more leverage to negotiate down drug prices with manufacturers in contrast the us has a patchwork of public and private insurance and partly relies on middlemen to set prices the presidents policy directs the office of the us trade representative and the department of commerce to fight what the administration called unreasonable and discriminatory policies in foreign countries that unfairly undercut market prices and drive price hikes in the united states in a statement on monday the pharmaceutical industrys biggest lobbying group phrma lauded trump for taking aim at other nations for what they deemed not paying their fair share but other countries governments are simply negotiating within the limits of their national health budgets not using unfair methods like trump claims said lawrence gostin a professor of public health law at georgetown university he added that they are securing fair prices for their own countries which has nothing to do with undercutting the us its unclear what actions the us could take to force other nations to take action but anderson said there is currently no incentive for them to hike their prices they have a system that works for them and they get lower prices countries like france and switzerland are all not going to sit there and say hey now i want to pay more he said the pharmaceutical industry would likely want to to see price hikes in countries within the european union before it voluntarily lowers any drug prices in the us jpmorgan analysts said that makes other pieces of the executive order appear unlikely to come to pass trumps order directs the health and human services secretary to establish a way for us patients to buy their drugs directly from manufacturers at most favored nation prices cutting out middlemen the order mentions directtoconsumer purchasing programs without further details his plan also calls for hhs secretary robert f kennedy jr to give drugmakers price reduction targets within the next days which will open up negotiations with the companies if adequate progress is not made toward those goals within six months of the order being signed hhs will impose most favored nation pricing on drugs through rulemaking or other aggressive measures according to the order but anderson said it would likely take far longer for the government and drugmakers to agree on a price under a provision of the inflation reduction act medicare and drug manufacturers typically take six months to a year to negotiate prices he added why would any drug company ever lower their prices voluntarily anderson noted that the order did not provide details on the exact actions the administration could take against drugmakers who dont agree so the incentives are unclear the department of justice and federal trade commission will also take action against anticompetitive actions that keep prices high in the us white house officials said there will be an expectation that those prices should come down and then if they dont we will be looking at our various policy levers that can be used to force those prices down one official said we absolutely are going to get a better deal the order also directs the food and drug administration to consider expanding imports from other developed nations beyond canada trump signed a separate executive order in april directing the fda to improve the process by which states can apply to import lowercost drugs from canada among other actions intended to lower drug prices the trump administration claims that some drug prices will fall by up to almost immediately white house officials also said the administration will have a particular focus on drugs that have the largest disparities and largest expenditures which could include popular weight loss and diabetes treatments called glp drugs but experts cast doubts on whether the administration can cut prices significantly as its still unclear which drugs and nations will be targeted and whether other countries and drugmakers will comply we dont know the list of nations included said tricia neuman executive director for the program on medicare policy at kff a health policy research group their pricing would make a big difference in what our prices would be which could then affect access in the us in andersons view the order as written wont be effective at lowering drug prices its a great idea to pay international prices but its how you get to implement it there are no details and ability to effectuate it he said gostin also added that americans will likely not see lower prices in the foreseeable future still aarp which advocates for older americans thanked trump for issuing the order in a statement on monday its safe to say that we are excited about any attempts to help bring down prescription drug prices said leigh purvis the prescription drug policy principal in aarps public policy institute this approach is unusually understandable to the public because i think theres a general understanding that america does pay the highest prescription drug prices in the world she added that the devil is in the details and thats what were looking forward to seeing more of the pharmaceutical industry has argued that a most favored nation policy will hurt its profits and ability to research and develop new drugs last week phrma even that trumps proposal if applied to the medicaid program specifically could cost drugmakers as much as trillion over a decade but mondays executive order seems to be more of a headline risk than the sweeping shift for the pharmaceutical industry many had feared bmo capital markets analyst evan seigerman said in a note on monday he pointed to the uncertain path forward for the plan saying it could be more rhetoric than actual implementable policy seigerman added that trump appeared to be somewhat sympathetic to us manufacturers with the president arguing that european nations are not supporting drug research and development due to their lower prices anderson said the pharmaceutical industry may be breathing a sigh of relief today pending further details on what the administrations retaliatory actions could look like trumps order suggests that it is ultimately voluntary for drugmakers to lower prices and subsequently profits so he did not propose something that is mandatory and really has teeth here still while phrma agreed with trumps decision to target other countries the group emphasized that importing foreign prices from socialist countries would be a bad deal for american patients and workers it would mean less treatments and cures and would jeopardize the hundreds of billions our member companies are planning to invest in america threatening jobs hurting our economy and making us more reliant on china for innovative medicines the group said in a statement some analysts and experts said trump could alternatively implement his most favored nation policy through an existing tool to push down drug prices its a key provision of the biden administrations inflation reduction act that gives medicare the power to negotiate certain prescription drug prices with manufacturers the federal program is currently in its of talks with drugmakers the trump administration could use the most favored nation price for a given drug as the initial offer to manufacturers at the beginning of negotiations anderson said youd be starting the negotiation at an even lower price than they have in the past he said adding that it would not require any help from congress jpmorgan analysts added that we see a clearer pathway for the administration to implement the most favored nation policy at a smaller scale through medicare ira price negotiations where the impact would be limited to a small number of drugs and make the hit to drugmaker profits more gradual"}

as its obesity injection wegovy loses ground to s rival treatment zepbound while eli lilly entered the market later it is emerging as the frontrunner in a space that some analysts believe could be worth more than billion by the early s novo nordisks new top executive will need to help the company close the gap with eli lilly fend off emerging rivals and navigate other challenges the next ceo

place but the company said it is considering both internal and external candidates while novo nordisk took a commanding early lead in the obesity duopoly they have ceded ground at a critical moment when more competitors are quickly approaching bmo capital markets analyst evan seigerman said in a note friday referring to other drugmakers racing to market their own obesity treatments novo nordisk once held the title of europes most valuable company worth billion at its peak driven by skyrocketing demand for wegovy and its diabetes counterpart ozempic but investor enthusiasm has faded after eli lilly gained a bigger share of the market and clinical trial data on novo nordisks next wave of obesity drugs underwhelmed investors shares of novo nordisk have plunged more than over the past year wiping out more than billion in market value novo nordisks stock is still up more than since jrgensen took over as ceo in january but shares of eli lilly have gained about since that same month when ceo dave ricks took over the company mounting pressure also came from the powerful novo nordisk foundation the controlling shareholder of the danish drugmaker the foundation recently urged novo nordisks leadership to consider an accelerated ceo succession and pushed for greater board representation according to a on friday novo nordisk on friday said it jointly concluded with jrgensen that it was time to find a new ceo following the foundations request recent market challenges and the steep decline in the companys share price jrgensen said he did not see his ouster coming and was only informed of it recently according to several on friday days before the announcement novo nordisk slashed its sales and profit forecast for the first time since the launch of wegovy four years ago seigerman said its still unclear whether a new top executive will be able to address the companys challenges although it might satisfy some for investors to drive a ceo transition without meaningful change in nearterm strategy we continue to see a more difficult path forward he said novo nordisk has been ceding market share to eli lilly even though zepbounds dollar sales still trail wegovys zepbound and eli lillys diabetes drug mounjaro now make up over half of us prescriptions for socalled glps which mimic hormones to tamp down appetite and regulate blood sugar according to a separate note from seigerman earlier this month that outpaces the combined share of novo nordisks wegovy and ozempic new us prescriptions of zepbound surpassed those for wegovy for the first time in early march just months after the launch of eli lillys drug reported at the time by august some analysts were estimating that zepbound had captured of the us weight loss drug market hot on wegovys heels that marketshare traction clearly demonstrates that physicians and patients prefer zepbound over wegovy bernstein analyst courtney breen wrote in a note in early may realworld data and have shown that zepbound leads to more weight loss than wegovy novo nordisk has also struggled to convince wall street that its pipeline of nextgeneration weight loss drugs can help it maintain its position in the market especially after wegovy loses exclusivity and drugmakers can sell cheaper generic alternatives for example novo nordisk repeatedly told investors its cagrisema shot expected to be launched in would help people lose or more of their body weight but the in december sending shares of the company plunging the company in april said it has filed for us approval of an oral version of semaglutide the active ingredient in wegovy and ozempic it comes as drugmakers rush to develop more convenient weight loss pills which could account for billion of the market in the coming years according to some analyst but seigerman in a separate note in april said novo nordisk has no clear strategy for its oral obesity drug portfolio he said that is likely to challenge growth in the end of the decade

employees to think of themselves like cockroaches due to the creatures grimy resilience and noted ability to survive harsh conditions it was the identity of every individual in the company said joshua sturm a vice president at hinge from to and now chief revenue officer at cancer prevention startup color health we are all in this together and no matter what happens we are going to survive together perez and his person workforce now face the ultimate test of their mettle hinge which moved from london to san francisco in is trying to go public at a time of such extreme economic uncertainty and market volatility that several companies including online lender and ticket marketplace have delayed their longawaited ipos hinge filed its prospectus announcing plans to trade on the new york stock exchange under the ticker symbol hnge three weeks later announced a sweeping tariff policy that plunged us markets into turmoil after tariff concerns had already pushed the nasdaq to its worst quarter since but hinge led by its yearold cofounder and ceo appears determined to power through the chaos hinge declined to comment or make perez available for an interview going public was already going to be a risky endeavor for hinge the ipo market has been since late when soaring inflation and rising interest rates pushed investors out of risky assets within digital health its been almost completely dead healthtech companies have struggled to adapt to a more muted growth environment following the covid pandemic and many once promising business models havent panned out as planned the starkest example is virtual health company which has a market cap of just over billion less than five years after buying digital health provider livongo in a deal that valued the at billion teladocs betterhelp mental health unit has been a particularly troublesome business as paying users dropped off in the years following the pandemic over time hinges cockroach award transitioned from a monthly prize to a quarterly distinction the company phased it out entirely about a year ago in preparation for its next publicfacing chapter but the surviveatallcosts mentality persists according to current employees now staffers are recognized with the movers awards a nod to the companys focus on movement we have many decades of work ahead perez wrote in a letter to investors in march we hope you join us on this journey cnbc spoke to current and former hinge employees investors and people close to perez for this story some of whom asked not to be named in order to provide candid commentary hinge uses software to help patients treat acute musculoskeletal injuries chronic pain and carry out postsurgery rehabilitation remotely large employers like and cover the costs so their employees can access hinges appbased virtual physical therapy as well as its wearable electrical nerve stimulation device called enso the company its technology can help users manage pain cut down healthcare costs and reduce the need for surgery and opioids revenue increased to million last year while its net loss narrowed to million from million a year earlier according to the prospectus hinges roster of clients expanded by last year to and the number of individual members jumped to over the filing said in an on monday hinge revenue in its first quarter climbed to million up from million during the same period last year and that net income for the period was million compared to a loss of million a year ago hinge has raised more than billion from investors including tiger global management and coatue management and it boasted a as of october the last time the company raised outside funding the biggest institutional shareholders are venture firms insight partners and atomico which own and of the stock respectively according to the filing perez and gabriel mecklenburg hinges executive chairman started the company in the pair met while they were both pursuing phds in the uk perez at the university of oxford and mecklenburg at imperial college london they were distracted students according to perezs twin brother david by the time they launched hinge perez and mecklenburg had already cofounded two other ventures together one was the oxbridge biotech roundtable an organization that connected academics and industry experts the other was marblar which worked to commercialize academic intellectual property perez took a leave of absence from oxford while working on marblar and never returned his brother wasnt a fan of the decision initially i gave him terrible advice said david perez a graduate of yale law school and partner at perkins coie in seattle i was like i think youre an idiot i think you should focus on your phd only an idiot would not finish a phd at oxford the twins have two older siblings their mother immigrated from cuba in followed years later by their father their parents met in miami got married after just three dates and are still together after more than years the family moved from miami to salt lake city utah in perezs mother was a substitute teacher and his father worked at restaurants as a dishwasher and busboy david perez said their father worked around the clock and used to call out orders in his sleep it wasnt a lot of money i think combined they made about a year david perez said but they stitched it together and raised four kids the twin boys were competitive particularly when it came to academics and playing basketball in the driveway david said his brother got great grades and always had an inclination toward science and medicine graduating from high school at age and then starting college at westminster university a small liberal arts school in utah i swear david perez said there were times where the only punishment that my mom could issue that would have the sting was restricting our ability to do homework perez was a student in the honors college at westminster and he graduated with a degree in biology richard badenhausen dean of the honors college described perez as an independent thinker and an ambitious student especially for his age he didnt care too much what people thought about him which is a strength in my book badenhausen said in an interview when perez was he was hit by a car he broke an arm and a leg and had to be airlifted to a nearby hospital after three surgeries and months of rehab he had a newfound interest in orthopedics and physical therapy mecklenburg had a serious injury of his own tearing his anterior cruciate ligament acl during a judo match which also required a year of rehab according to hinges website one day in october the pair put their heads together and outlined the tools they wished were available while undergoing physical therapy musculoskeletal conditions affect as many as billion people worldwide according to hinges prospectus so there was no shortage of opportunities they had the early concept of hinge within hours and a prototype ready by december of that year in hinges early days perez and mecklenburg would meet every saturday morning to talk shop now as theyve aged and started families they meet on wednesday nights according to colleagues perez welcomed his first child with his wife late last year seeing the growth over the last six seven eight years has just been unbelievable said jon reynolds a tech founder who contributed to hinges seed funding round that comes down to the quality of dan and gabriel as leaders they complement each other really well and theyve obviously got that mutual respect perez is a handson ceo who expects a lot from his staff hes direct detailoriented opinionated competitive and can be intense according to current and former employees but hes committed to the mission and the wellbeing of his employees they said hes one of those rare founder ceos who i think can go all the way said paul kruszewski a former hinge employee who joined the company after it acquired his canadian computer vision startup wrnch in employees say perez is a voracious reader often finishing two to four books a month that includes books about business and leadership an important source of information given that hinge was his first real job hes a fan of the innovators prescription by and others crossing the chasm by geoffrey moore and the long fix by dr vivian lee he also likes his staffers to read executives will often prepare to discuss chapters from a book in their meetings id come home and thered be a package from dan and its a book said sturm who led partnerships and new market development at hinge that was just the norm sturm who has worked in the healthcare and benefits space for around years said hinge was very deliberate with hiring so there wasnt a lot of turnover among senior executives he said hinges recruitment process was the hardest hes ever experienced another danism as sturm called it is hinges philosophy around writing perez has employees write memos typically up to six pages long instead of preparing slide decks or other materials ahead of meetings perez was inspired by a similar practice at according to current and former employees and sees it as a way to force employees to think through what they want to say instead of hiding behind bullet points hinges memo culture can be an adjustment particularly for new employees sturm said he thought the practice was insane at first but ultimately came to appreciate it and said it improved his pitches when you sort of sit back you go you know actually he wasnt wrong sturm said hinge has come a long way since venture firm atomico led the million series a investment in the londonbased firm said in a at the time that it was extremely impressed by daniel and gabriel and their determination to tackle a big problem in society carolina brochado led the round though she left atomico a year later and now works at investment firm eqt group she said that getting hinge to the brink of an ipo was a one in a million chance but noted that the company has managed to build a sizable business in digital health despite having so many odds stacked against it lots of learnings along the way of course like a big tech correction in the middle brochado said in an interview but it really is one of those rare examples of just an enormous market that was under penetrated for david perez whose firm now serves as hinges outside counsel watching the startup grow has been fascinating he said im a partner at a major law firm he said and i am only the second most successful twin but i think im okay with that"}

"title": "whoop launches two new wearables with day battery life", "description": "", "content": "on thursday announced two new whoop and whoop mg which feature sleeker hardware a longer battery life and additional inapp health insights both of the companys new devices are designed for wear the whoop and whoop mg support days of battery life which is around triple the fourtofiveday range offered by whoop the new hardware is also smaller than the previous device with a processor thats faster the company said weve taken everything weve learned over the past decade and built a platform to help our members perform and live at their peak for longer whoop founder and ceo said in a release the launch marks whoops first major hardware update since when the company released whoop whoop said its new devices will help users understand how their daily decisions impact their performance and outcomes over time according to a release there are three annual membership tiers whoop one which costs and includes the whoop whoop peak which costs and includes the whoop and whoop life which costs and includes the whoop mg accessories like additional bands will come at an extra cost whoop and whoop mg memberships and accessories are available for purchase online starting on thursday whoop one members will be able to use their whoop to measure sleep strain and recovery as well as the cardiovascular and muscular impact of various workouts users can also track their menstrual cycles and pregnancies whoop peak builds on those core metrics members have access to a health monitor feature which provides a quick look at vitals like respiratory rate heart rate blood oxygen and skin temperature whoop peak also supports a realtime stress monitor where users can see their stress level and complete guided breathing sessions if theyd like to increase relaxation or alertness the company also unveiled a feature called healthspan which uses nine metrics to calculate adult users whoop age and pace of aging a users whoop age compares their physiological age to their actual age and pace of aging assesses how fast or slow someone is aging based on their behavior the healthspan feature is updated every week and users will get tips about how they can improve their whoop age and pace of aging in their app whoop developed this feature in partnership with the buck institute for research on aging the company said the most comprehensive membership is whoop life which will give users access to additional medicalgrade health features with whoop mg whoop life members can record an electrocardiogram or an ecg to detect irregular heart rhythms like afib high heart rate or low heart rate once the reading is complete they can share a pdf of the recording with their doctor the ecg feature has been cleared by the us food and drug administration its not intended for users under years old or for users with a cardiac pacemaker or other implanted devices it will be available in the us the uae and qatar at launch with additional countries coming soon whoop life members can also get daily insights about their blood pressure including estimated systolic and diastolic ranges users will have to log a traditional cuffreading to act as a baseline to unlock this feature and its not intended for treatment diagnosis or medical use whoop said blood pressure insights has been in development for several years and the feature is currently in beta i got a sneak peek at the whoop mg and ive been wearing it for the past few days i cant speak to what its like to wear the device over an extended period but my initial experience has been largely positive from a hardware standpoint the whoop mg looks and feels sleeker than the whoop which i tested out in april the actual sensor is roughly an inch wide and the band is slightly thinner than that ive found that both the whoop mg and the whoop are a little hard to take off you really have to tug on the latch the whoop mgs setup is very straightforward and i was up and running on the app in a matter of minutes with all the new features theres a lot of additional data to make sense of so the app seemed pretty busy to me at

arms thats been disappointing as im interested to see my results the blood pressure insights are neat and assuming other users can successfully record ecg readings its easy to see the potential benefit that said i dont think i need those features in my daily life yet so the whoop life membership probably wouldnt be the right pick for me im not totally sold on the whoop mgs aesthetics i have small hands and wrists so i always feel like smart devices tend to look clunky on me i definitely felt like the whoop was too big for me but the whoop mg doesnt bother me quite as much thats just my personal taste and there are lots of whoop accessories you can buy to spiff up the device for different occasions after just a few days theres a lot i can still learn from the whoop mg but i feel like id personally reach for the whoop the range of membership options helps ensure that users dont have to break the bank so id feel comfortable recommending whoop and whoop mg to my friends and family

rick gates walgreens chief pharmacy officer it gives us a lot more flexibility to bring down costs to increase the care and increase speed to therapy all those things he said gates added that the centers give walgreens a competitive advantage because independent pharmacies and some rivals dont have centralized support for their stores still and have similarly tested or their own microfulfillment facilities to dispense grocery items and other prescriptions microfulfillment centers come with their own risks such as a heavy reliance on sophisticated robotics that can cause disruptions if errors occur but the facilities are becoming a permanent fixture in retail due to the cost savings they offer and their ability to streamline workflows reduce the burden on employees and deliver goods to customers faster when a walgreens retail pharmacy receives a prescription the system determines whether it should be filled at that location or routed to a nearby microfulfillment center maintenance medications or prescription drugs taken regularly to manage chronic health conditions and refills that dont require immediate pickup are often sent to microfulfillment at the core of each facility is a highly automated system that uses robotics conveyor belts and barcode scanners among other tools to fill prescriptions the operations are supported by a team of pharmacists pharmacy technicians and other professionals instead of staff members filling prescriptions by hand at stores pill bottles move through an automated and carefully choreographed assembly line pharmacy technicians fill canisters with medications for robot pods to dispense and pharmacists verify those canisters to make sure they are accurate yellow robotic arms grab a labeled prescription vial and hold it up to a canister which precisely dispenses the specific medication for that bottle certain prescriptions are filled at separate manual stations including inhalers and birth control pill packs each prescription is then sorted and packaged for delivery back to retail pharmacy locations for final pickup there are other security and safety measures throughout the process said ahlam antar registered group supervisor of a microfulfillment center in mansfield massachusetts for example the robot pods automatically lock and signal an error with a redorange light if a worker attaches a canister to the wrong dispenser preventing the incorrect pills from going in a prescription she said properly training workers at the centers to ensure accuracy and patient safety is also crucial according to sarah gonsalves a senior certified pharmacy technician at the mansfield site she said a core part of her role is to make sure that technicians can correctly perform the different tasks in the process antar who has worked at the mansfield site since its opening said walgreens has made improvements to the microfulfillment process after considering feedback from stores and patients during the paused expansion that includes establishing new roles needed to support the process at the sites such as a training manager for all locations the facilities also plan to transition to using smaller prescription vials after hearing concerns that the current bottles are too large according to a walgreens spokesperson they said that will allow the centers to ship more prescriptions per order and reduce costs heffington said the automated locations have helped reduce walgreens overall prescription fulfillment costs by nearly compared to a year ago she said walgreens has also increased prescription volume by yearoveryear now filling more than million prescriptions annually the company hopes to raise that number to million or even more heffington added that walgreens implemented new internal tools to track the work across all centers and provide realtime data on where a patients prescription is in the microfulfillment process if a patient called the store and said hey can you tell me where my prescription is today workers can do that with great specificity thanks to the new tools heffington said despite the companys progress gates said there is more work to be done with microfulfillment centers for example he pointed to the possibility of shipping prescriptions directly to patients doorsteps instead of putting that burden on retail stores its only step one right now he said other improvements may still be needed at facilities according to some reports for example wral news in april that some customers at a walgreens store in garner north carolina say they are only getting partial prescription fills with several pills missing or their medicine is being delayed before brian ganges arizona store started relying on an automated facility he walked into the pharmacy every morning knowing that a massive list of prescriptions was in his work queue waiting to be filled for the day now with help from microfulfillment that list is significantly smaller each day according to gange we dont have to spend as much time on just those repetitive fulfillment tasks he told cnbc it really takes a huge weight off our shoulders gange said that gives him and his team time to step behind the pharmacy counter and interact with customers facetoface answering questions providing advice performing health tests or administering vaccines that kind of attention can make all the difference for a patient for example gange recalls stepping away for five minutes to take a patients blood pressure despite being overwhelmed with tasks while working at a different walgreens location several years ago he ended up sending that person to the emergency room because their blood pressure was off the charts that patients wife visited the pharmacy the next day to thank gange saying her husband probably wouldnt be here with us today without that blood pressure test i shouldnt have to question whether i have that five or minutes to check a blood pressure for a patient gange said microfulfillment and centralized services are really what are going to allow us to be able to do that to have that time that really allows us to provide better care for them he added"}],

safety measures throughout the process said ahlam antar registered group supervisor of a microfulfillment center in mansfield massachusetts for example the robot pods automatically lock and signal an error with a redorange light if a worker attaches a canister to the wrong dispenser preventing the incorrect pills from going in a prescription she said properly training workers at the centers to ensure accuracy and patient safety is also crucial according to sarah gonsalves a senior certified pharmacy technician at the mansfield site she said a core part of her role is to make sure that technicians can correctly perform the different tasks in the process antar who has worked at the mansfield site since its opening said walgreens has made improvements to the microfulfillment process after considering feedback from stores and patients during the paused expansion that includes establishing new roles needed to support the process at the sites such as a training manager for all locations the facilities also plan to transition to using smaller prescription vials after hearing concerns that the current bottles are too large according to a walgreens spokesperson they said that will allow the centers to ship more prescriptions per order and reduce costs heffington said the automated locations have helped reduce walgreens overall prescription fulfillment costs by nearly compared to a year ago she said walgreens has also increased prescription volume by yearoveryear now filling more than million prescriptions annually the company hopes to raise that number to million or even more heffington added that walgreens implemented new internal tools to track the work across all centers and provide realtime data on where a patients prescription is in the microfulfillment process if a patient called the store and said hey can you tell me where my prescription is today workers can do that with great specificity thanks to the new tools heffington said despite the companys progress gates said there is more work to be done with microfulfillment centers for example he pointed to the possibility of shipping prescriptions directly to patients doorsteps instead of putting that burden on retail stores its only step one right now he said other improvements may still be needed at facilities according to some reports for example wral news in april that some customers at a walgreens store in garner north carolina say they are only getting partial prescription fills with several pills missing or their medicine is being delayed before brian ganges arizona store started relying on an automated facility he walked into the pharmacy every morning knowing that a massive list of prescriptions was in his work queue waiting to be filled for the day now with help from microfulfillment that list is significantly smaller each day according to gange we dont have to spend as much time on just those repetitive fulfillment tasks he told cnbc it really takes a huge weight off our shoulders gange said that gives him and his team time to step behind the pharmacy counter and interact with customers facetoface answering questions providing advice performing health tests or administering vaccines that kind of attention can make all the difference for a patient for example gange recalls stepping away for five minutes to take a patients blood pressure despite being overwhelmed with tasks while working at a different walgreens location several years ago he ended up sending that person to the emergency room because their blood pressure was off the charts that patients wife visited the pharmacy the next day to thank gange saying her husband probably wouldnt be here with us today without that blood pressure test i shouldnt have to question whether i have that five or minutes to check a blood pressure for a patient gange said microfulfillment and centralized services are really what are going to allow us to be able to do that to have that time that really allows us to provide better care for them he added"}

in the us in andersons view the order as written wont be effective at lowering drug prices its a great idea to pay international prices but its how you get to implement it there are no details and ability to effectuate it he said gostin also added that americans will likely not see lower prices in the foreseeable future still aarp which advocates for older americans thanked trump for issuing the order in a statement on monday its safe to say that we are excited about any attempts to help bring down prescription drug prices said leigh purvis the prescription drug policy principal in aarps public policy institute this approach is unusually understandable to the public because i think theres a general understanding that america does pay the highest prescription drug prices in the world

executive order seems to be more of a headline risk than the sweeping shift for the pharmaceutical industry many had feared bmo capital markets analyst evan seigerman said in a note on monday he pointed to the uncertain path forward for the plan saying it could be more rhetoric than actual implementable policy seigerman added that trump appeared to be somewhat sympathetic to us manufacturers with the president arguing that european nations are not supporting drug research and development due to their lower prices anderson said the pharmaceutical industry may be breathing a sigh of relief today pending further details on what the administrations retaliatory actions could look like trumps order suggests that it is ultimately voluntary for drugmakers to lower prices and subsequently

can apply to import lowercost drugs from canada among other actions intended to lower drug prices the trump administration claims that some drug prices will fall by up to almost immediately white house officials also said the administration will have a particular focus on drugs that have the largest disparities and largest expenditures which could include popular weight loss and diabetes treatments called glp drugs but experts cast doubts on whether the administration can cut prices significantly as its still unclear which drugs and nations will be targeted and whether other countries and drugmakers will comply we dont know the list of nations included said tricia neuman executive director for the program on medicare policy at kff a health policy research group their pricing would make a big difference in what our prices would be which could then affect access in the us in andersons view the order as written wont be effective at lowering drug prices its a great idea to pay international prices but its how you get to implement it there are no details and ability to effectuate it he said gostin also added that americans will likely not see lower prices in the foreseeable future still aarp which advocates for older americans thanked trump for issuing the order in a statement on monday its safe to say that we are excited about any attempts to help bring down prescription drug prices said leigh purvis the prescription drug policy principal in aarps public policy institute this approach is unusually understandable to the public because i think theres a general understanding that america does pay the highest prescription drug prices in the world she added that the devil is in the details and thats what were looking forward to seeing more of the pharmaceutical industry has argued that a most favored nation policy will hurt its profits and ability to research and develop new drugs last week phrma even that trumps proposal if applied to the medicaid program specifically could cost drugmakers as much as trillion over a decade but mondays executive order seems to be more of a headline risk than the sweeping shift for the pharmaceutical industry many had feared bmo capital markets analyst evan seigerman said in a note on monday he pointed to the uncertain path forward for the plan saying it could be more rhetoric than actual implementable policy seigerman added that trump appeared to be somewhat sympathetic to us manufacturers with the president arguing that european nations are not supporting drug research and development due to their lower prices anderson said the pharmaceutical industry may be breathing a sigh of relief today pending further details on what the administrations retaliatory actions could look like trumps order suggests that it is ultimately voluntary for drugmakers to lower prices and subsequently profits so he did not propose something that is mandatory and really has teeth here still while phrma agreed with trumps decision to target other countries the group emphasized that importing foreign prices from socialist countries would be a bad deal for american patients and workers it would mean less treatments and cures and would jeopardize the hundreds of billions our member companies are planning to invest in america threatening jobs hurting our economy and making us more reliant on china for innovative medicines the group said in a statement some analysts and experts said trump could alternatively implement his most favored nation policy through an existing tool to push down drug prices its a key provision of the biden administrations inflation reduction act that gives medicare the power to negotiate certain prescription drug prices with manufacturers the federal program is currently in its of talks with drugmakers the trump administration could use the most favored nation price for a given drug as the initial offer to manufacturers at the beginning of negotiations anderson said youd be starting the negotiation at an even lower price than they have in the past he said adding that it would not require any help from congress jpmorgan analysts added that we see a clearer pathway for the administration to implement the most favored nation policy at a smaller scale through medicare ira price negotiations where the impact would be limited to a small number of drugs and make the hit to drugmaker profits more gradual"}
