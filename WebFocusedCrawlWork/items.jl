Its products are sold in approximately 125 countries. The company was founded in 1876 by Eli Lilly, a pharmaceutical chemist and Union army veteran during the American Civil War for whom the company was later named.[6]As of October 2024, Lilly is the most valuable drug company in the world with a $842 billion market capitalization, the highest valuation ever achieved to date by a drug company.[7]  The company is ranked 127th on the Fortune 500 with revenue of $34.12 billion.[8] It is ranked 221st on the Forbes Global 2000 list of the world's largest publicly-traded companies[9] and 252nd on Forbes' list of \"America's Best Employers\".[10]Lilly is known for its clinical depression drugs Prozac (fluoxetine) (1986), Cymbalta (duloxetine) (2004), and its antipsychotic medication Zyprexa (olanzapine) (1996). The company's primary revenue drivers are the diabetes drugs Humalog (insulin lispro) (1996) and Trulicity (dulaglutide) (2014).[11]Lilly was the first company to mass-produce both the polio vaccine, developed in 1955 by Jonas Salk, and insulin. It was one of the first pharmaceutical companies to produce human insulin using recombinant DNA,  including Humulin (insulin medication), Humalog (insulin lispro), and the first approved biosimilar insulin product in the U.S., Basaglar (insulin glargine).[12]  Lilly brought exenatide to market\u2014the first of the GLP-1 receptor agonists[13]\u2014followed by blockbuster drugs in the same class such as Mounjaro and Zepbound (tirzepatide).[7] \nAs of 1997, it was both the largest corporation and the largest charitable benefactor in Indiana.[14] In 2009, Lilly pleaded guilty for illegally marketing Zyprexa and agreed to pay a $1.415 billion penalty that included a criminal fine of $515 million, the largest ever in a healthcare case and the largest criminal fine for an individual corporation ever imposed in a U.S. criminal prosecution of any kind at the time.[15][16]Lilly is a full member of the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America[17] and the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations (EFPIA).[18]History[edit]Founding[edit]Main article: Eli LillyEli Lilly (1838\u20131898), a Union army officer who founded the company in 1876The company was founded by Colonel Eli Lilly, a pharmaceutical chemist and Union army veteran of the American Civil War. Lilly served as the company president until his death in 1898.[19]In 1869, after working for drugstores in Indiana, Lilly became a partner in a Paris, Illinois-based drugstore with James W. Binford.[20] Four years later, in 1873, Lilly left the partnership with Binford, and returned to Indianapolis. In 1874, Lilly partnered with John F. Johnston, and opened a drug manufacturing operation called Johnston and Lilly. \nTwo years later, in 1876, Lilly dissolved the partnership, and used his share of the assets to open his own pharmaceutical manufacturing business, Eli Lilly and Company, in Indianapolis.[21][22] The sign outside, above the shop's door, read: \"Eli Lilly, Chemist.\"[19][23][24] \nLilly began his manufacturing venture with three employees, including his son, Josiah (J. K.).[25][22] One of the first medicines that Lilly produced was quinine, a drug used to treat malaria, a mosquito-borne disease.[26] By the end of 1876, sales reached $4,470.[26]19th century[edit]In 1878, Lilly hired his brother, James, as his first full-time salesman, and the subsequent sales team marketed the company's drugs nationally.[27] By 1879, the company had grown to $48,000 in sales.[26]The company moved its Indianapolis headquarters from Pearl Street to larger quarters at 36 South Meridian Street. In 1881, the company moved to its current headquarters in Indianapolis's south-side industrial area, and the company later purchased additional facilities for research and production.[28][29] The same year, Lilly incorporated the business as Eli Lilly and Company, elected a board of directors, and issued stock to family members and close associates.[27]Lilly's first innovative product was gelatin-coating for pills and capsules. The company's other early innovations included fruit flavorings and sugarcoated pills, which made the medicines easier to swallow.[25]In 1882, Colonel Lilly's only son, Josiah K. Lilly Sr. (J. K.), a pharmaceutical chemist, graduated from the Philadelphia College of Pharmacy in Philadelphia, and returned to Indianapolis to join the family business as a superintendent of its laboratory.[30][20][31]In 1883, the company contracted to mix and sell Succus Alteran, its first widely successful product and one its best sellers. The product was marketed as a \"blood purifier\" and as a treatment for syphilis, some types of rheumatism, and skin diseases such as eczema and psoriasis.[29][32] Sales from the product provided funds for Lilly to expand its manufacturing and research facilities.[33] By the late 1880s, Colonel Lilly was one of the Indianapolis area's leading businessmen, whose company had over 100 employees and $200,000 ($5,276,296 in 2015 chained dollars) in annual sales.[20]In 1890, Colonel Lilly fully turned over the day-to-day management of the business to J. K., who ran the company for 34 years. The 1890s were a tumultuous decade economically, but the company flourished.[20][34] In 1894, Lilly purchased a manufacturing plant to be used solely for creating capsules. The company also made several technological advances in the manufacturing process, including automating its capsule production. Over the next few years the company annually created tens of millions of capsules and pills.[35]In 1898, Lilly's son, J. K. Lilly, inherited the company and became its president following Colonel Lilly's death.[36][37] At the time of Colonel Lilly's death, the company had a product line of 2,005 items and annual sales of more than $300,000 ($8,547,600 in 2015 chained dollars).[38] Colonel Lilly was a pioneer in the modern pharmaceutical industry, with many of his early innovations later becoming standard practice. His ethical reforms in a trade that was marked by outlandish claims of miracle medicines began a period of rapid advancement in the development of medicinal drugs.[39] J. K. Lilly continued to advocate for federal regulation on medicines.[40]As the Lilly company grew, other businesses set up operations near the plant on Indianapolis's near south side. The area developed into one of the city's major business and industrial hubs. Lilly's production, manufacturing, research, and administrative operations in Indianapolis eventually occupied a complex of more than two dozen buildings, which covered 15-block area, in addition to its production plants along Kentucky Avenue.[41]In addition to Colonel Lilly, his brother, James, and son, Josiah (J. K.), the growing company employed other Lilly family. Colonel Lilly's cousin, Evan Lilly, was hired as a bookkeeper.[34] As young boys, Lilly's grandsons, Eli and Josiah Jr. (Joe), ran errands and performed other odd jobs. Eli and Joe joined the family business after college. Eventually, each grandson served as company president and chairman of the board.[42]Under J. K.'s leadership, the company introduced scientific management concepts, organized the company's research department, increased its sales force, and began international distribution of its products.[43]For the rest of the late 19th century, Lilly operated in Indianapolis and the surrounding area as many other pharmaceutical businesses did, manufacturing and selling \"sugar-coated pills, fluid extracts, elixirs, and syrups\".[32] The company used plants for its raw materials and produced its products by hand. One historian noted, \"Although the Indianapolis firm was more careful in making and promoting drugs than the patent medicine men of the era, the company remained ambivalent about scientific research.\"[32]20th century[edit]An assortment of Lilly's throat lozenges from a 1906 sales bookJosiah K.

K. Lilly oversaw a large expansion of the company, and it reached annual sales of $1 million ($26,381,481 in 2015 chained dollars).[37]Before and after World War I, the company experienced rapid growth,[32] including expanded manufacturing facilities at its McCarty Street plant, which improved production capacity with a new Science Building (Building 14), opened in 1911, and a new capsule plant (Building 15) in 1913.[44] In 1913, the company began construction of Lilly Biological Laboratories, a research and manufacturing plant on 150 acres near Greenfield, Indiana.[45][46]In addition to development of new medicines, the company achieved several technological advances, including automation of its production facilities. Lilly was also an innovator in pill capsule manufacturing. It was among the first manufacturers to insert medications into empty gelatin capsules, which provided a more exact dosage.[19] Lilly manufactured capsules for its own needs and sold its excess capacity to others.[47] \nIn 1917, Scientific American described Lilly as \"the largest capsule factory in the world\" and reported that the company was \"capable of producing 2.5 million capsules a day\".[47] One of Lilly's early innovations was fruit flavoring for medicines and sugar-coated pills to make their medicines easier to swallow.[25] Over the next few years, the company began to create tens of millions of capsules and pills annually.[35]Other advances improved plant efficiency and eliminated production errors. In 1909, Eli Lilly, grandson of the company's founder, introduced a method for blueprinting manufacturing tickets,[48] which created multiples copies of a drug formula and helped eliminate manufacturing and transcription errors.[47] \nIn 1919, Josiah hired biochemist George Henry Alexander Clowes as director of biochemical research.\nIn the 1920s, Eli introduced the new concept of straight-line production to the pharmaceutical industry, where raw materials entered at one end of the facility and the finished product came out the other end, in the company's manufacturing process. Under Eli's supervision, the design for Building 22, a new five-floor plant that opened in Indianapolis in 1926, implemented the straight-line concept to improve production efficiency and lower production costs.[49][50] One historian noted, \"It was probably the most sophisticated production system in the American pharmaceutical industry.\"[50] This more efficient manufacturing process also allowed the company to hire a regular workforce. Instead of recalling workers at peak times and laying them off when production demand fell, Lilly's regular workforce produced less-costly medicines in off-peak times using the same manufacturing facilities.[42]During the 1920s, the introduction of new products brought the company financial success.[32] In 1921, three University of Toronto scientists, John Macleod, Frederick Banting, and Charles Best, were working on the development of insulin for treatment of diabetes.[51] Clowes proposed a collaboration with the researchers in December 1921, and then again March and May 1922. The researchers were hesitant to work with a commercial drug firm, particularly since they had the Connaught Laboratories' non-commercial facilities at hand. But as limits were reached at the scale to which Connaught could produce insulin, Clowes and Eli Lilly met with the researchers in 1922 to negotiate an agreement with the University of Toronto scientists to mass-produce insulin.[52][53][54] The collaboration greatly accelerated the large-scale production of the extract.[55]In 1923, the company began selling Iletin, the company's tradename for the first commercially available insulin product in the U.S for the treatment of diabetes.[56] Numerous objections were registered by the Insulin Committee of the University of Toronto in regard to Lilly's use of the term \"Iletin\", although production continued under this name and the objection was later dropped \"as a concession\".[57][58]Also in 1923, Banting and Macleod were awarded the Nobel Prize for their research, which they subsequently shared with co-discoverers Charles Best and James Collip.[59][60] Insulin, \"the most important drug\" in the company's history, did \"more than any other\" to make Lilly \"one of the major pharmaceutical manufacturers in the world.\"[51] Eli Lilly and Company enjoyed an effective monopoly on the sale of insulin in the U.S. for almost two years, until the first of the new American licensees, Frederick Stearns & Co., entered the market in June 1924.[61]The success of insulin enabled the company to attract scientists and, with them, make more medical advances. By the company's 50th anniversary in 1926, its sales had reached $9 million and it was producing over 2,800 products.[42]In 1928, Lilly introduced Liver Extract 343 for the treatment of pernicious anemia, a blood disorder, in a joint venture with two Harvard University scientists, George Minot and William P. Murphy. In 1930, Lilly introduced Liver Extract No. 55 in collaboration with George Whipple, a University of Rochester scientist.[62] Four years later, in 1934, Minot, Murphy, and Whipple were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for their research.[63]In the 1930s, the company also continued expansion overseas.[64] In 1934, Eli Lilly and Company Limited, the company's first overseas subsidiary was established in London, and a manufacturing plant was opened in Basingstoke.[65][64]In 1932, despite the economic challenges of the Great Depression, Lilly's sales rose to $13 million.[65] The same year, Eli Lilly, eldest grandson of Col. Lilly who had joined the company in 1909, was named as the company's president, succeeding his father, who remained as chairman of the board until 1948.[37] In his early years at the company, Eli was especially interested in improving production efficiency and introduced a number of labor-saving devices. He also introduced scientific management principles, implemented cost-savings measures that modernized the company,[66] and expanded the company's research efforts and collaborations with university researchers.[67]In 1934, the firm opened two new facilities on the McCarty Street complex: a replica of Lilly's 1876 laboratory and the new Lilly Research Laboratories, \"one of the most fully equipped facilities in the world.\"[68] \nDuring World War II, the company expanded production to a new high, manufacturing merthiolate, an organomercury compound, and penicillin, a beta-lactam antibiotic. Lilly also cooperated with the American Red Cross to process blood plasma. By the end of World War II, the company had dried over two million pints of blood, \"about 20 percent of the United States' total\".[69] Merthiolate, first introduced in 1930, was an \"antiseptic and germicide\" that became a U.S. Army standard issue during World War II.[70][71][72]International operations expanded even further during World War II.[64] In 1943, Eli Lilly International Corp. was formed as a subsidiary to encourage business trade abroad. By 1948, Lilly employees worked in 35 countries, most of them as sales representatives in Latin America, Asia, and Africa.[64]In 1945, Lilly began a major expansion effort that included two manufacturing operations in Indianapolis. The company purchased the massive Curtiss-Wright propeller plant on Kentucky Avenue, west of the company's McCarty Street operation. When renovation was completed in mid-1947, the Kentucky Avenue location manufactured antibiotics and capsules and housed the company's shipping department.[73] By 1948, Lilly employed nearly 7,000 people.[23]In 1948, Eli Lilly, who served as the company's president since 1932, retired from active management, became chairman of the board, and relinquished the presidency to his brother, Josiah K. Lilly Jr. (Joe).[74] During Eli's 16-year presidency, sales rose from $13 million in 1932 to $117 million in 1948. Joe joined the company in 1914 and concentrated on the company's personnel and marketing efforts.[38] He served as company president from 1948 to 1953, then became chairman of the board, and remained in that capacity until his death in 1966.[75]Throughout the mid-20th century, Lilly continued to expand its production facilities outside of Indianapolis. In 1950, Lilly launched Tippecanoe Laboratories in Lafayette, Indiana,[76] and increased antibiotic production with its patent on erythromycin. \nIn the 1950s, Lilly introduced two new antibiotics, vancomycin, a glycopeptide antibiotic, and erythromycin.[77]  In the 1950s and 1960s, as generic drugs began flooding the marketplace after the expiration of patents, Lilly diversified into other areas, including agricultural chemicals, veterinary medicine products, cosmetics, and medical instruments.\nIn 1952, the company offered its first public shares of stock, which are traded on the New York Stock Exchange.[78] In 1953, Eugene N. Beesley was named the company's new president, the first non-family member to run the company.[79]In 1953, following a company reorganization and transition to non-family management, Lilly continued to expand its global presence. In 1954, Lilly formed Elanco Products Company, named after its parent company, for the production of veterinary pharmaceuticals.\nAlso in 1954, the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis, now the March of Dimes, contracted with five pharmaceutical companies, Lilly, Cutter Laboratories, Parke, Davis and Company, Pitman-Moore Company, and Wyeth Laboratories to produce Salk's polio vaccine for clinical trials.[80] Lilly's selection to produce the vaccine was, in part, due to its previous experience in collaborations with university researchers.[81] In 1955, Lilly manufactured 60 percent of Salk's polio vaccine.\nIn the 1960s, Lilly operated 13 affiliate companies outside the United States.[82] In 1962, the company acquired The Distillers Company and established a major factory in Liverpool, England. In 1968, Lilly built its first research facility outside the United States, the Lilly Research Centre, in Surrey, England. In 1969, the company opened a new plant in Clinton, Indiana.[76] \nDuring the 1970s and 1980s, Eli Lilly and Company underwent a flurry of drug production, including Keflex, an antibiotic, in 1971, Dobutrex, a cardiogenic shock heart drug in 1977, Ceclore, which ultimately became the world's top selling oral antibiotic, in 1979, Eldisine, a leukemia drug, Oraflex, an arthritis drug, and Darvon, an opioid drug used in pain management.\nIn 1971, the company became a component of the S&P 500 Index. To further diversify its product line, Lilly made an uncharacteristic, but ultimately profitable move in 1971, acquiring cosmetic manufacturer Elizabeth Arden, Inc. for $38 million. Although Arden continued to lose money for five years after Lilly acquired it, executive management changes at Arden helped to ultimately turn it into a financial success. By 1982, Arden's \"sales were up 90 percent from 1978, with profits doubling to nearly $30 million.\" In 1987, 16 years after acquiring it, Lilly sold Arden to Faberg\u00e9 for $657 million.[83]In 1977, Lilly ventured into medical instruments with the acquisition of IVAC Corporation, which manufactures vital signs and intravenous fluid infusion monitoring systems.[84] The same year, Lilly acquired Cardiac Pacemakers, Inc., a manufacturer of heart pacemakers. In 1980, Lilly acquired Physio-Control, a pioneering company in defibrillation. Other acquisitions included Advance Cardiovascular Systems in 1984, Hybritech in 1986, Devices for Vascular Intervention, in 1989, Pacific Biotech in 1990, and Origin Medsystems and Heart Rhythm Technologies, in 1992. In the early 1990s, Lilly combined its newly acquired medical equipment companies into a Medical Devices and Diagnostics Division that \"contributed about 20 percent\" of Lilly's annual revenues.[citation needed]In 1989, a joint agrochemical venture between Elanco and Dow Chemical created DowElanco. In 1997, Lilly sold its 40% share in the company to Dow Chemical for $1.2 billion and the name was changed to Dow AgroSciences.[85]In 1991, Vaughn Bryson was named CEO of Eli Lilly and Company. During Bryson's 20-month tenure, the company reported its first quarterly loss as a publicly traded company.[86] \nIn 1993, Randall L. Tobias, vice chairman of AT&T Corporation and a Lilly board member, was named Lilly's chairman, president, and CEO after \"product and competitive pressures\" had \"steadily eroded Lilly's stock price since early 1992.\"[87] Tobias was the first president and CEO recruited from outside of the company. Under Tobias's leadership, the company \"cut costs and narrowed its mission\".[88] Lilly sold companies in its Medical Device and Diagnostics Division, expanded international sales, made new acquisitions, and funded additional research and product development. \nIn 1994, Lilly acquired PCS Systems, the largest drug benefits health maintenance organization at the time, for $4 billion, and later added two similar organizations to its holdings.[89][90]In 1998, Sidney Taurel, Lilly's former chief operating officer, was named CEO, replacing Tobias. Also in 1998, Lilly formed a joint venture with Icos Corporation (ICOS), a Bothell, Washington-based biotechnology company, to develop and commercialize Cialis, a product for the treatment of erectile dysfunction. In January 1999, Taurel was named chairman. In 2000, Lilly reported $10.86 billion in net sales.\n21st century[edit]Eli Lilly and Company's corporate headquarters in Indianapolis, in 2019In September 2002, Lilly agreed to partner with Amylin Pharmaceuticals to develop and commercialize Amylin's exotic new drug based on exendin-4, a novel substance isolated from the venom of the Gila monster.[91] Exenatide, the first of the GLP-1 receptor agonists, was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in April 2005.[13]In October 2006, Lilly announced its intention to acquire Icos for $2.1 billion, or $32 per share.[92] After its initial attempt to acquire Icos failed under pressure from large institutional shareholders, Lilly increased its offer to $34 per share. Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS), a proxy advisory firm, advised Icos shareholders to reject the proposal as undervalued.[93][94] But Lilly's offer was approved by Icos' shareholders, and Lilly completed the acquisition of the company in January 2007.[95][96] Lilly subsequently closed Icos' manufacturing operations, terminated nearly 500 Icos employees, leaving 127 employees working at the biologics facility.[97] In December 2007, CMC Biopharmaceuticals A/S (CMC), a Copenhagen-based provider of contract biomanufacturing services, bought the Bothell, Washington-based biologics facility from Lilly and retained the existing 127 employees.[94][97][98]In January 2009, the largest criminal fine in U.S. history, totaling $1.415 billion, was imposed on Lilly for illegal marketing of its best-selling product, the atypical antipsychotic medication, Zyprexa.[99][15][16]In January 2011, Boehringer Ingelheim and Lilly announced a global agreement to jointly develop and market new APIs for diabetes therapy. Lilly could receive more than $1 billion for their work on the project, while Boehringer Ingelheim could receive more than $800 million from development of the new drugs.[100] Boehringer Ingelheim's oral anti-diabetic Linagliptin, BI 1077, and two of Lilly's insulin analogs, LY2605541 and LY2963016, were in phase II and III of clinical development at that time.\nIn April 2014, Lilly announced plans to acquire Switzerland-based Novartis AG's animal health business for $5.4 billion in cash to strengthen and diversify its Elanco unit. Lilly said it planned to fund the deal with about $3.4 billion of cash on hand and $2 billion of loans.[101] As a condition of the acquisition, the Sentinel heartworm treatment was divested to Virbac in order to avoid a monopoly in a subsector of the heartworm (Dirofilaria immitis) treatment market.[102]In March 2015, the company announced it would join Hanmi Pharmaceutical in developing and commercializing Hanmi's phase I Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitor HM71224 in a deal that could yield $690 million.[103] A day later, however, the company announced another deal with China's Innovent Biologics to co-develop and commercialize at least three of Innovent's treatments over the next decade, in a deal which could generate up to $456 million; the collaboration was subsequently expanded in 2022, according to Innovent. As part of the deal, the company contributed its c-Met monoclonal antibody, and Innovent contributed a monoclonal antibody, which targets CD-20. The second compound from Innovent is a preclinical immunooncology molecule.[104] The following week, the company announced it would restart its collaboration with Pfizer surrounding the Phase III trial of Tanezumab. Pfizer is expected to receive an upfront sum of $200 million from the company.[105] \nIn April 2015, Lilly engaged CBRE Group to sell its biomanufacturing facility in Vacaville, California,[106] a 52 acres (0.21\u00a0km2) campus and facility that is one of the largest biopharmaceutical manufacturing centers in the U.S.[106]In January 2017, Elanco Animal Health, a subsidiary of the company completed the acquisition of Boehringer Ingelheim Vetmedica, Inc., a subsidiary of Boehringer Ingelheim's U.S. feline, canine, and rabies vaccines portfolio. \nIn March 2017, Lilly acquired CoLucid Pharmaceuticals for $960 million, obtaining the late clinical-stage migraine therapy candidate, lasmiditan.[107] In August 2017, Lilly and Shionogi jointly licensed their product varespladib to Ophirex for Ophirex's novel snakebite treatment program.[108]In May 2018, Lilly acquired Armo Biosciences for $1.6 billion.[109] Days later, the company announced it would acquire Aurora kinase A inhibitor developer AurKa Pharma, and control over the lead compound, AK-01, for up to $575 million.[110][111]In January 2019, Lilly announced it would acquire Loxo Oncology for $235 per share, valuing the business at around $8 billion,which significantly expanded the business's oncology offerings. The deal gave Lilly Loxo's oral TRK inhibitor, Vitrakvi (Larotrectinib), LOXO-292, an oral proto-oncogenereceptor tyrosine kinase rearranged during transfection (RET) inhibitor, LOXO-305, an oral Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor, and LOXO-195, a follow-on TRK inhibitor.[112][113] In August 2019, Elanco acquired the Bayer animal health business for $7.6 billion.[114][115]In January 2020, the company announced its acquisition of Dermira for $1.1 billion, gaining control of lebrikizumab,glycopyrronium cloth used in the treatment of  hyperhidrosis, and other assets.[116][117][118] \nIn June 2020, Lilly announced that, in collaboration with Vancouver-based AbCellera, it had begun the world's first study of a potential monoclonal antibody treatment for treatment of COVID-19, with a Phase 1 trial of LY-CoV555.[119][120] By August 2020, the challenging aspects of running a clinical trial in a long-term care facility during a pandemic prompted Lilly to create the first of many customized recreational vehicles into mobile research units (MRU) to meet people where they were and support mobile labs and clinical trial material preparation. A trailer truck could escort the MRU with supplies to create an on-site infusion clinic. Lilly deployed the mobile research unit fleet in response to outbreaks of the virus at long-term care facilities across the U.S. In September 2020, Amgen announced that they had partnered with Lilly to manufacture their COVID-19 antibody therapies.[121] \nIn October 2020, Lilly announced that its cocktail was effective and that it had filed with the FDA for an emergency use authorization (EUA) for it.[122] The same day, Lilly's corporate rival Regeneron also filed for an EUA for its own monoclonal antibody treatment.[123] The same month, Lilly announced it would acquire Disarm Therapeutics and its experimental treatments for axonal degeneration, via SARM1 inhibitors, for $135 million plus a further $1.225 billion based on regulatory and commercial milestones.[124] \nAlso in October 2020, Lilly announced that the National Institutes of Health (NIH) ACTIV-3 clinical trial evaluating its monoclonal antibody, bamlanivimab (LYCoV555), found that bamlanivimab was not effective in treating people hospitalized with COVID-19,[125] but data showed bamlanivimab might be effective in treating COVID-19 by reducing viral load, symptoms, and the risk of hospitalization in outpatients. Other studies, including the NIH ACTIV-2 trial and its own BLAZE-1 trial, continued to evaluate bamlanivimab.[125] In November 2020, the FDA issued an emergency use authorization (EUA) for the investigational monoclonal antibody therapy bamlanivimab for the treatment of mild-to-moderate COVID-19 in adult and pediatric patients.[126][127] In December 2020, Lilly announced it would acquire Prevail Therapeutics Inc. for $1 billion, boosting its pipeline in neurodegenerative disease gene therapies.[128]In April 2021, the FDA revoked the emergency use authorization (EUA) that allowed and signaled FDA agreement for the investigational monoclonal antibody therapy bamlanivimab, when administered alone, to be used for the treatment of mild-to-moderate COVID-19 in adults and certain pediatric patients.[129] On 18 May 2021, the FDA accepted Lilly's application for Tyvyt (sintilimab), in combination with Lilly's own Alimta (pemetrexed) and platinum chemotherapy for newly diagnosed nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer.[130] In July 2021, the company announced it would acquire Protomer Technologies for more than $1 billion.[131]In January 2022, distribution of Lilly's COVID-19 antibody drug was paused due to lack of efficacy against the emerging omicron variant.[132] A second COVID-19 monoclonal antibody therapy, bebtelovimab, developed with AbCellera, was granted Emergency Use Authorization in February 2022, with the U.S. government committing to a $720 million purchase of up to 600,000 doses.[133] \nIn May 2022, the FDA approved Lilly's type 2 diabetes drug Mounjaro (tirzepatide). In August 2022, following the overturning of Roe v. Wade in the Dobbs decision, the state of Indiana passed a near total ban on abortion, and Lilly said the move would make it difficult to attract talent to the state and that it would be forced to look for \"more employment growth\" elsewhere.[134]In October 2022, the business announced it would acquire Akouos Inc. for $487 million in upfront and $123 million deferred payments.[135][136] \nIn early 2020, Lilly introduced the Lilly Insulin Value Program, where people who have commercial insurance or no insurance can receive a savings card to fill their entire monthly prescription of any Lilly insulin for $35.[137] In 2023, the Inflation Reduction Act extended a similar concept across all insulin suppliers by capping out-of-pocket costs for insulin at $35 per monthly prescription among Medicare Parts B and D enrollees.\nIn January 2023, Lilly and TRexBio announced a collaboration and license agreement for three assets to treat immune-mediated diseases.[138] TRexBio received an upfront payment of $55 million as part of this deal.[139] In June the company announced it would acquire startup Emergence Therapeutics[140] for an undisclosed sum and Sigilon Therapeutics for $300 million.[141] The company's 2023 research and development focus has been reported to be on drugs in the obesity, diabetes, Alzheimer's and autoimmune areas.[142] \nIn July 2023, Lilly announced it would acquire Versanis for $1.93 billion.[143] In October 2023, Eli Lilly acquired Point Biopharma for $1.4 billion.[144]In November 2023, the FDA approved tirzepatide for the treatment of obesity under the brand name Zepbound.[145]In March 2024, Lilly announced a deal with Amazon to offer home delivery of certain medications for diabetes, obesity, and migraines, on behalf of LillyDirect.[146]As of October 2024, tirzepatide's success as a blockbuster weight-loss drug had transformed Eli Lilly into the most valuable drug company in the world with a $842 billion market capitalization, the highest valuation ever achieved by a drug company to date, followed only by Novo Nordisk.[7]Acquisition history[edit].mw-parser-output .hidden-begin{box-sizing:border-box;width:100%;padding:5px;border:none;font-size:95%}.mw-parser-output .hidden-title{font-weight:bold;line-height:1.6;text-align:left}.mw-parser-output .hidden-content{text-align:left}@media all and (max-width:500px){.mw-parser-output .hidden-begin{width:auto!important;clear:none!important;float:none!important}}Eli Lilly and Company acquisitions.mw-parser-output .treeview ul{padding:0;margin:0}.mw-parser-output .treeview li{padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none;list-style-image:none}.mw-parser-output .treeview li li{background:url(\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f2/Treeview-grey-line.png\")no-repeat 0 -2981px;padding-left:21px;text-indent:0.3em}.mw-parser-output .treeview li li:last-child{background-position:0 -5971px}.mw-parser-output .treeview li.emptyline>ul>.mw-empty-elt:first-child+.emptyline,.mw-parser-output .treeview li.emptyline>ul>li:first-child{background-position:0 9px}Eli Lilly and Company(founded 1876)Eli Lilly and Company\nDistillers Company (acq. 1962)Elizabeth Arden, Inc.(acq. 1971, sold Faberg\u00e9 in 1987)IVAC Corporation (acq. 1977)Cardiac Pacemakers Inc.

In 1886, Ernest G. Eberhardt, a chemist, joined the company as its first full-time research scientist.[149] Lilly also hired two botanists, Walter H. Evans and John S. Wright, to join its early research efforts.[33][150] \nAfter World War I, the company's expanded production facilities and introduction of new management methods set the stage for Lilly's next crucial phase\u2014its \"aggressive entry into scientific research and development.\"[23] The first big step came in 1919 when Josiah Lilly hired biochemist George Henry Alexander Clowes as director of biochemical research.[151] Clowes had extensive medical research expertise and links to the scientific research community, which led to the company's collaborations with researchers in the U.S. and elsewhere.[152] Clowes's first major collaboration with researchers who developed insulin at the University of Toronto significantly impacted the company's future.[152] Lilly's success with insulin production secured the company's position as a leading research-based pharmaceutical manufacturer, allowing it to attract and hire more research scientists and to collaborate with other universities in additional medical research.[153] \nIn 1934, the company built a new research laboratory in Indianapolis.[51] As part of its research and product development process Lilly also conducted clinical studies at Indianapolis City Hospital. Lilly continues to conduct clinical studies to test medications before their introduction to the market. \nIn 1949, Eli Lilly went into partnership with the United States Army Reserve, setting up a local Strategic Intelligence Research and Analysis (SIRA) Unit to allow employees to research company data for the scientific logistics and Eurasian fields of study. \nIn 1998, the company dedicated new laboratories for clinical research at the Indiana University Medical Center in Indianapolis.\nPublicly funded research[edit]Lilly is involved in publicly funded research projects with other industrial and academic partners. One example is non-clinical safety assessment is the InnoMed PredTox, a collaboration with pharmaceutical companies, research organizations, and the European Commission to improve the safety of drugs.[154][155] \nIn 2008, this consortium, which included Lilly S.A. in Switzerland, secured an \u20ac8 million budget for a 40-month project that was coordinated by the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations (EFPIA), an organization who represents the research-based pharmaceutical industry and biotech companies operating in Europe.[155][156][157] \nIn 2008, Lilly's activities included research projects within the framework of the Innovative Medicines Initiative, a public-private research initiative in Europe that is a joint effort of the EFPIA and the European Commission.[158][159][160]Public-private engagement[edit]Academia[edit]Northern Ontario School of Medicine (NOSM), donor[161]Population Health Research Institute (PHRI) at McMaster University, partner[162]University of Toronto, donor to the Boundless Campaign[163] and member of the President's Circle[164]University of Washington, member of the Honor Roll of Donors, having contributed between $10 million and $50 million to funding the school as of 2020[165]Conferences and summits[edit]World Neuroscience Innovation Forum, stakeholder sponsor[166]Media[edit]National Press Foundation, donor[167]Medical societies[edit]American Society of Hematology, sponsor[168]Arthritis Society, national partner[169]Endocrine Society, corporate Liaison Board member[170]European Society of Cardiology, sponsor of the EURObservational Research Programme[171]Non-governmental organizations[edit]HOPE Worldwide, partner[172]Political lobbying[edit]Alliance for Competitive Taxation, member[173]BIOTECanada, member company.[174] BIOTECanada lobbies the Canadian government for policies favorable to the pharmaceutical industry.[175]Foundation for the National Institutes of Health (FNIH), donor, given between $5,000,000 and $9,999,999 between 1997 and 2020, contributing to funding the activities of the National Institutes of Health[176]Innovative Medicines Canada, member[177] The group lobbies the Government of Ontario and House of Commons of Canada through Rubicon Strategy, a firm owned by Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario campaign manager Kory Teneycke.[178][179][180]International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers & Associations, member[181]National Health Council (NHC), member organization.

In addition to penicillin, other wartime production included \"antimalarials,\" blood plasma, encephalitis vaccine, typhus and influenza vaccine, gas gangrene antitoxin, Merthiolate, and Iletin (Insulin, Lilly).[211]Among the company's other pharmaceutical developments are cephalosporin, erythromycin, and Prozac (fluoxetine), a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) for the treatment of clinical depression. Ceclor, introduced in the 1970s, was an oral cephalosporin antibiotic. Prozac, introduced in the 1980s, quickly became the company's best-selling product for treatment of depression, but Lilly lost its U.S. patent protection for the product in 2001. Among other distinctions, Lilly is the world's largest manufacturer and distributor of medications used in a broad range of psychiatric and mental health-related conditions, including clinical depression, generalized anxiety disorder, narcotic addiction, insomnia, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and others.[citation needed]In March 2023, Eli Lilly announced a $35 cap on the price of monthly insulin to be put in place immediately in order to be in line with the Inflation Reduction Act.[212]Medications that provide significant revenue for Lilly include Trulicity, Mounjaro, Verzenio, Taltz, Jardiance, Humalog, Cyramza, Olumiant, Emgality, Tyvyt, Retevmo, Alimta, and Zepbound.[2]Cialis[edit]Main article: TadalafilIn 2003, Eli Lilly and Company introduced Cialis (tadalafil), a competitor to Pfizer's blockbuster Viagra for erectile dysfunction. Cialis maintains an active period of 36 hours, causing it sometimes to be dubbed the \"weekend pill\". Cialis was developed in a partnership with biotechnology company Icos Corporation. In December 2006, Lilly bought Icos in order to gain full control of the product.[213]Cymbalta[edit]Main article: DuloxetineAnother Lilly manufactured anti-depressant, Cymbalta, a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor used predominantly in the treatment of major depressive disorders and generalized anxiety disorder, ranks with Prozac as one of the most financially successful pharmaceuticals in industry history. It is also used in the treatment of fibromyalgia, neuropathy, chronic pain and osteoarthritis.[214][215]Kisunla[edit]Main article: DonanemabDonanemab, sold under the brand name Kisunla, is a monoclonal antibody used for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. Kisunla was approved by the US FDA in 2024.[216][217]Gemzar[edit]Main article: GemcitabineIn 1996, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved gemcitabine (Gemzar) for the treatment of pancreatic cancer. Gemzar is commonly used in the treatment of pancreatic cancer, usually in coordination with 5-FU chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Gemzar also is routinely used in the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer.[citation needed][218]Methadone[edit]Main article: MethadoneLilly was the first distributor of methadone in the United States, an analgesic used frequently in the treatment of heroin, opium and other opioid and narcoticdrug addictions.[219][220] Eli Lilly was able to acquire the right to produce the drug commercially for just $1 because the patent rights of the original patent holders, IG Farben and Farbwerke Hoechst, were not protected after the Allies of World War II seized all German patents, research records and trade names. Eli Lilly introduced the drug to the United States in 1947, marketed under the trade name \"Dolophine\".[221]Prozac[edit]Main article: FluoxetineProzac was one of the first therapies in its class to treat clinical depression by blocking the uptake of serotonin within the human brain. Prozac was approved by the US FDA in 1987 for use in treating depression, with generic versions appearing after 2002.\nSecobarbital[edit]Main article: SecobarbitalLilly has manufactured Secobarbital, a barbiturate derivative with anesthetic, anticonvulsant, sedative and hypnotic properties. Lilly marketed Secobarbital under the brand name Seconal. Secobarbital is indicated for the treatment of epilepsy, temporary insomnia and as a pre-operative medication to produce anesthesia and anxiolysis in short surgical, diagnostic, or therapeutic procedures which are minimally painful. With the onset of new therapies for the treatment of these conditions, Secobarbital has been less utilized, and Lilly ceased manufacturing it in 1999.[citation needed]Secobarbital gained considerable attention during the 1970s, when it gained wide popularity as a recreational drug. In September 1970, rock guitarist legend Jimi Hendrix died from a secobarbital overdose. In June 1969, secobarbital overdose was the cause of death of actress Judy Garland. The drug was a central part of the plot of the hugely popular novel Valley of the Dolls (1966) by Jacqueline Susann in which three highly successful Hollywood women each fall victim, in various ways, to the drug. The novel was later released as a film by the same name.[citation needed]Thiomersal[edit]Main article: ThiomersalLilly has developed the vaccine preservative thiomersal (also called merthiolate and thimerosal). Thiomersal is effective by causing susceptible bacteria to autolyze. Launched in 1930, merthiolate was a mercury-based antiseptic and germicide that \"had been formulated at the University of Maryland with support of a Lilly research fellowship.\"[71] In November 2002,[222] congressional Republicans inserted a provision into a domestic security bill that President George W. Bush signed into a law, protecting Eli Lilly from all suits in the federal courts, alleging that the drug, Thiomersal caused autism and other neurological disorders in children, such that all such matters be heard by a special master appointed for the purpose, rather than regular federal courts. Its toxicology was that it metabolized into ethylmercury (C2H5Hg+) and thiosalicylate, in the body. However, since the mid 2000\u2019s it has mostly fallen out of use.\nZyprexa[edit]Main article: OlanzapineZyprexa (Olanzapine) (for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, as well as off-label uses) Released in 1996, (see Illegal marketing of Zyprexa) it was the company's best selling drug through 2010, when the patent expired.[223]Leadership[edit]David Ricks, Lilly CEO since 2016After three generations of Lilly family leadership under company founder, Col. Eli Lilly, his son, Josiah K. Lilly Sr., and two grandsons, Eli Lilly Jr. and Josiah K. Lilly Jr., the company announced a reorganization in 1944 that prepared the way for future expansion and the eventual separation of company management from its ownership.[224] The large, complex corporation was divided into smaller groups headed by vice presidents and in 1953 Eugene N. Beesley was named the first non-family member to become the company's president.[82]Although Lilly family members continued to serve as chairman of the board until 1969, Beesley's appointment began the transition to non-family management.[82] In 1972 Richard Donald Wood[225] became Lilly's president and CEO after the retirement of Burton E. Beck.[226] In 1991 Vaughn Bryson became president and CEO[225] and Wood became board chairman.[227] During Bryson's 20-month tenure as Lilly's president and CEO, the company reported its first quarterly loss as a publicly traded company.[86]Randall L. Tobias, a vice chairman of AT&T Corporation, was named chairman, president, and CEO in June 1993. Tobias, a Lilly board member since 1986, was recruited from outside the company's executive ranks[86] first to replace Lilly's president and CEO, Vaughn Bryson, at Bryson's predecessor and then board chairman Richard Wood's urging and then, in short order, also Wood.[225] Tobias later became the US director of Foreign Assistance and administrator of the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), with the rank of ambassador.[228]Sidney Taurel, former chief operating officer of Lilly, was named CEO in July 1998 to replace Tobias, who retired. Taurel became chairman of the board in January 1999.[229] Taurel retired as CEO in March 2008, but remained as chairman of the board until 31 December 2008. John C. Lechleiter was elected as Lilly's CEO and president, effective 1 April 2008. Lechleiter had served as Lilly's president and chief operating officer since October 2005.[230]In July 2016 it was announced that Lechleiter would be retiring. David Ricks was voted to succeed his position.[231]Community service[edit]The Lilly family as well as Eli Lilly and Company has a long history of community service. Around 1890 Col. Lilly turned over operation of the family business to his son, Josiah, who ran the company for the next several decades.[33] Col. Lilly remained active in civic affairs and assisted a number of local organizations, including the Commercial Club of Indianapolis, which later became the Indianapolis Chamber of Commerce,[232] and the Charity Organization Society, a forerunner to the Family Services Association of Central Indiana, an organization supported by United Way.[33][233] Josiah's sons, Eli and Joe, were also philanthropists who supported numerous cultural and educational organizations.[234]Josiah Sr. continued his father's civic mindedness and began the company tradition of sending aid to disaster victims.[37] Following the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, the company sent much needed medicine to support recovery efforts and provided relief after the 1936 Johnstown Flood.[37]In 1917, Lilly Field Hospital 32, named in Josiah's honor, was equipped in Indianapolis and moved overseas to Contrexville, France, during World War I, where it remained in operation until 1919.[37] Throughout World War II, Lilly manufactured more than two hundred products for military use, including aviator survival kits and seasickness medications for the D-Day invasion.[65] In addition Lilly dried more than two million pints of blood plasma by the war's end.[69]Lilly Endowment[edit]Main article: Lilly EndowmentIn 1937, Josiah K. Lilly Sr. and his two sons, Eli and Joe, founded the Lilly Endowment, a private charitable foundation, with gifts of Lilly stock.[235] The endowment still owns 11.3% of the company.[5]Eli Lilly and Company Foundation[edit]The Eli Lilly and Company Foundation, which is separate from the Lilly Endowment, operates as a tax-exempt private charitable foundation that the company established in 1968. The Foundation is funded through Lilly's corporate profits.[236]Controversies[edit]BGH[edit]Further information: bovine growth hormoneIn August 2008, Eli Lilly purchased the right to manufacture bovine growth hormone, used to increase milk production in dairy cattle, from Monsanto.[237] Use of the supplement has become controversial due to the animal ethics and human health concerns.[238]340B[edit]Main article: 340B Drug Pricing ProgramIn 2021, Eli Lilly filed a court motion against in response to an advisory opinion of the Department of Health and Human Services indicating that Eli Lilly and other drug manufacturers must continue to offer reduced pricing to covered outpatient drugs through pharmacies contracted to hospitals rather than only to the hospitals themselves.[239][240][241]Prozac[edit]Further information: Standard Gravure shooting and FluoxetineIn September 1989, Joseph T. Wesbecker killed eight people and injured twelve before committing suicide.[242] His relatives and victims blamed his actions on the Prozac medication he had begun taking a month prior. The incident set off a chain of lawsuits and public outcries.[243] Lawyers began using Prozac to justify the abnormal behaviors of their clients.[244] Eli Lilly was accused of not doing enough to warn patients and doctors about the adverse effects, which it had described as \"activation\", years prior to the incident.[245] The link between suicide and antidepressants remains a subject of public and academic dispute.\nIn October 2004, the FDA added a boxed warning to all antidepressant drugs regarding use in children.[246] In 2006, the FDA included adults aged 25 or younger.[247] In February 2018, the FDA ordered an update to the warnings based on statistical evidence from twenty-four trials in which the risk of such events increased from two percent to four percent relative to the placebo trials.[248]Illegal marketing of Zyprexa[edit]See also: Olanzapine \u00a7\u00a0Controversy, lawsuits and settlements; and James Gottstein \u00a7\u00a0Eli Lilly memosEli Lilly has faced many lawsuits from people who claimed they developed diabetes or other diseases after taking olanzapine (branded Zyprexa), an antipsychotic medication, as well as by various governmental entities, insurance companies, and others. Internal documents provided to The New York Times revealed that Lilly had downplayed the risks of Zyprexa. According to the documents, 16 percent of people taking Zyprexa gained more than 66 pounds in their first year, a much larger figure than Eli Lilly had shared with doctors.[249]In 2006, Lilly paid $700 million to settle around 8,000 of these lawsuits,[250] and in early 2007, Lilly settled around 18,000 suits for $500 million, which brought the total Lilly had paid to settle suits related to the drug to $1.2 billion.[249][251]In March 2008, Lilly settled a suit with the state of Alaska,[252] and in October 2008, Lilly agreed to pay $62 million to 32 states and the District of Columbia to settle suits brought under state consumer protection laws.[253] In 2009, four sales representatives for Eli Lilly filed separate qui tam lawsuits against the company for illegally marketing Zyprexa for uses not approved by the Food and Drug Administration.\nEli Lilly pleaded guilty to a US federal criminal misdemeanor charge of illegally marketing Zyprexa, actively promoting the drug for off-label uses, particularly for the treatment of dementia in the elderly.[254] The $1.415 billion penalty included an $800 million civil settlement, a $515 million criminal fine, and forfeit assets of $100 million.[15] The US Justice Department said the criminal fine of $515 million was the largest ever in a healthcare case and the largest criminal fine for an individual corporation ever imposed in a US criminal prosecution of any kind.[15][16] \"That was a blemish for us,\" John C. Lechleiter, CEO of Lilly, said. \"We don't ever want that to happen again. We put measures in place to assure that not only do we have the right intentions in integrity and compliance, but we have systems in place to support that.\"[255] In an internal email, Lechleiter had stated \"we must seize the opportunity to expand our work with Zyprexa in this same child-adolescent population\" for off-label use.[256]In January 2020, lawyer James Gottstein published a book titled The Zyprexa Papers summarizing the legal activities surrounding Zyprexa, and their impact on the political landscape of psychiatry and antipsychiatry in the US.[257] The book details of how he obtained the Zyprexa papers, including how Will Hall and a small group of \"psychiatric survivors\" untraceably spread the Zyprexa Papers on the Internet and his battles on behalf of Bill Bigley, the psychiatric patient whose ordeal made possible the exposure of the Zyprexa Papers.[258]Discrimination[edit]In March 2021, Eli Lilly and Company was accused of sex discrimination by a former lobbyist who claimed she was forced to work in a sexually hostile work environment.[259] The parties involved settled for an undisclosed amount in June 2021.[260]In September 2021, Eli Lilly and Company was accused in a federal court lawsuit of discriminating against older applicants for sales positions based on their implementation of hiring quotas for millennials.[261]Canada patent lawsuit[edit]In September 2013, Eli Lilly sued Canada for violating its obligations to foreign investors under the North American Free Trade Agreement by allowing its courts to invalidate patents for Strattera and Zyprexa.[262] Canadian courts found Strattera's seven-week long study of twenty-two patients, too short and too narrow in scope to qualify for the patent. The Zyprexa patent was invalidated because it had not achieved its promised utility. The company sought damages in the amount of $500 million for lost profits. They ultimately lost the case in 2017.[263]Illegal marketing of Evista[edit]See also: EvistaEvista is a medication typically used to prevent and treat osteoporosis in postmenopausal women.\nIn December 2005, Eli Lilly and Company agreed to plead guilty and pay $36 million in connection with the illegal promotion of the drug.[264] Sales representatives were trained to promote Evista for breast cancer and cardiovascular disease, to prompt or bait questions by doctors, and to send them unsolicited letters promoting Evista for unapproved use. The company distributed a videotape in which a sales representative declared that \"Evista truly is the best drug for the prevention of all these diseases.\" Some sales representatives had also been instructed to conceal the disclosure page which stated that the effectiveness of the drug in reducing breast cancer risks had not yet been established.[citation needed]Insulin pricing[edit]In January 2019, lawmakers from the United States House of Representatives sent letters to Eli Lilly and other insulin manufacturers asking for explanations for their rapidly raising insulin prices. The annual cost of insulin for people with type 1 diabetes in the US almost doubled from $2,900 to $5,700 over the period from 2012 to 2016.[265]Renewed attention was brought to Eli Lilly's pricing of insulin in November 2022, after a verified Twitter account impersonating Eli Lilly posted on Twitter that insulin would now be free.[266][267][268] The following year, the company announced that it would be reducing the out-of-pocket price of insulin to $35 a month. The company also stated that it would lower the price of Humalog from $275 a month to $66 and that it would offer insulin glargine at a 78% discount compared to rival company Sanofi. Despite this, the reduced costs will not apply to Eli Lilly's newer brands of insulin, and the company's pricing is still significantly higher than it was several decades prior.[269]References[edit].mw-parser-output .reflist{margin-bottom:0.5em;list-style-type:decimal}@media screen{.mw-parser-output .reflist{font-size:90%}}.mw-parser-output .reflist .references{font-size:100%;margin-bottom:0;list-style-type:inherit}.mw-parser-output .reflist-columns-2{column-width:30em}.mw-parser-output .reflist-columns-3{column-width:25em}.mw-parser-output .reflist-columns{margin-top:0.3em}.mw-parser-output .reflist-columns ol{margin-top:0}.mw-parser-output .reflist-columns li{page-break-inside:avoid;break-inside:avoid-column}.mw-parser-output .reflist-upper-alpha{list-style-type:upper-alpha}.mw-parser-output .reflist-upper-roman{list-style-type:upper-roman}.mw-parser-output .reflist-lower-alpha{list-style-type:lower-alpha}.mw-parser-output .reflist-lower-greek{list-style-type:lower-greek}.mw-parser-output .reflist-lower-roman{list-style-type:lower-roman}^.mw-parser-output cite.citation{font-style:inherit;word-wrap:break-word}.mw-parser-output .citation q{quotes:\"\\\"\"\"\\\"\"\"'\"\"'\"}.mw-parser-output .citation:target{background-color:rgba(0,127,255,0.133)}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-free.id-lock-free a{background:url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/65/Lock-green.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-limited.id-lock-limited a,.mw-parser-output .id-lock-registration.id-lock-registration a{background:url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d6/Lock-gray-alt-2.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-subscription.id-lock-subscription a{background:url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/aa/Lock-red-alt-2.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .cs1-ws-icon a{background:url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg\")right 0.1em center/12px no-repeat}body:not(.skin-timeless):not(.skin-minerva) .mw-parser-output .id-lock-free a,body:not(.skin-timeless):not(.skin-minerva) .mw-parser-output .id-lock-limited a,body:not(.skin-timeless):not(.skin-minerva) .mw-parser-output .id-lock-registration a,body:not(.skin-timeless):not(.skin-minerva) .mw-parser-output .id-lock-subscription a,body:not(.skin-timeless):not(.skin-minerva) .mw-parser-output .cs1-ws-icon a{background-size:contain;padding:0 1em 0 0}.mw-parser-output .cs1-code{color:inherit;background:inherit;border:none;padding:inherit}.mw-parser-output .cs1-hidden-error{display:none;color:var(--color-error,#d33)}.mw-parser-output .cs1-visible-error{color:var(--color-error,#d33)}.mw-parser-output .cs1-maint{display:none;color:#085;margin-left:0.3em}.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-left{padding-left:0.2em}.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-right{padding-right:0.2em}.mw-parser-output .citation .mw-selflink{font-weight:inherit}@media screen{.mw-parser-output .cs1-format{font-size:95%}html.skin-theme-clientpref-night .mw-parser-output .cs1-maint{color:#18911f}}@media screen and (prefers-color-scheme:dark){html.skin-theme-clientpref-os .mw-parser-output .cs1-maint{color:#18911f}}\"Google Parent Alphabet Poaches Eli Lilly Finance Chief Ashkenazi\".

In 2010 UnitedHealth Group hired nine different lobbying firms to work on its behalf.[101] In addition, its corporate political action committee (PAC), called United for Health, spent an additional $1\u00a0million on lobbying activities.[102] UnitedHealth Group subsequently spent $4.11\u00a0million to $4.75\u00a0million from 2011 to 2021.[100]Criticism and controversies[edit]This section needs to be updated. Please help update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information.  (May 2023)SEC investigation[edit]In 2006, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) began investigating the conduct of UnitedHealth Group's management and directors, for backdating of stock options. Investigations were also started by the Internal Revenue Service and prosecutors in the U.S. attorney's office for the Southern District of New York, who subpoenaed documents from the company. The investigations came to light after a series of probing stories in the Wall Street Journal in May 2006, discussing the apparent backdating of hundreds of millions of dollars worth of stock options by UHC management. The backdating apparently occurred with the knowledge and approval of the directors, according to the Journal. Major shareholders have filed lawsuits accusing former New Jersey governor Thomas Kean and UHC's other directors of failing in their fiduciary duty.[103] On October 15, 2006, CEO William W. McGuire was forced to resign, and relinquish hundreds of millions of dollars in stock options.[104][105][106]On December 6, 2007, the SEC announced a settlement under which McGuire was to repay $468\u00a0million, including a $7\u00a0million civil penalty, as a partial settlement of the backdating prosecution. He was also barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for ten years.[107][108][109] This was the first time in which the little-used \"clawback\" provision under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act was used against an individual by the SEC. The SEC continued its investigations even after it in 2008 settled legal actions against both UnitedHealth Group itself and its former general counsel.[110]American Chiropractic Association lawsuit[edit]In June 2006, the American Chiropractic Association filed a national class-action lawsuit against the American Chiropractic Network (ACN), which is owned by UnitedHealth Group and administers chiropractic benefits, and against UnitedHealth Group itself, for alleged practices in violation of the federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO).[111] The Missouri Department of Insurance, Financial Institutions and Professional Registration determined that UnitedHealth Group violated state insurance laws, so levied $536,000 in fines and ordered more than 50,000 cases re-opened; any improperly denied claims must have been reimbursed with interest for chiropractors and patients.[112]OptumInsight, a.k.a. Ingenix lawsuit[edit]In February 2008, New York State Attorney General Andrew Cuomo announced an industry-wide investigation into a scheme by health insurers to defraud consumers by manipulating reasonable and customary rates. The announcement included a statement that Cuomo intended \"to file suit against Ingenix, Inc., its parent UnitedHealth Group, and three additional subsidiaries.\" Cuomo asserted that his investigation found that rates found in a database of health care charges maintained by Ingenix were lower than what he determined was the actual cost of certain medical expenses. Cuomo said this inappropriately allowed health insurance companies to deny a portion of provider claims, thereby pushing costs down to members.[113]On January 13, 2009, Ingenix announced an agreement with the New York State attorney settling the probe into the independence of the health pricing database. Under the settlement, UnitedHealth Group and Ingenix would pay $50\u00a0million to finance a new, non-profit entity that would develop a new healthcare pricing database. Ingenix would discontinue its medical pricing databases when the new entity makes its product available. The company acknowledged the appearance of a conflict of interest but admitted no wrongdoing.[114]On January 15, 2009, UnitedHealth Group announced a $350\u00a0million settlement of three class action lawsuits filed in Federal court by the American Medical Association, UnitedHealth Group members, healthcare providers, and state medical societies for not paying out-of-network benefits. This settlement came two days after a similar settlement with Cuomo.[115][116]On October 27, 2009, Cuomo announced the creation of FAIR Health, an independent, non-profit organization that would develop a nationwide database for consumer reimbursement, as well as a website where consumers would be able to compare prices before choosing doctors. To fund FAIR Health, the Attorney General's office secured nearly $100\u00a0million from insurers such as Aetna, UnitedHealth Group, and Anthem Inc.[117]Medicare overbilling lawsuit[edit]A whistleblower lawsuit filed in 2011 charged UnitedHealth Group's data analytics division with assisting in defrauding Medicare by boosting risk adjustment scores from Medicare Advantage companies. The suit alleged that UnitedHealth Group subsidiary Ingenix (now OptumInsight) \"defrauded the United States of hundreds of millions \u2013 and likely billions \u2013 of dollars.\" Former UnitedHealth executive Benjamin Poehling brought the suit under the False Claims Act. The government said it would proceed on claims against two healthcare companies, UnitedHealth and its Texas subsidiary WellMed Medical Management. In February 2017, a federal judge unsealed the suit after the Department of Justice announced it would join the case.[118][119]Richard Cole, and others v. UnitedHealthcare[edit]On April 29, 2019, Judge Robert N. Scola Jr. of the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida, a cancer survivor, recused himself from a case against UnitedHealthcare, stating that the company's denial of treatment was \"immoral and barbaric\", and that his opinions regarding the company would prevent him from \"deciding this case fairly and impartially.\"[120][121]PacifiCare fine in California[edit]In 2008, the California Department of Insurance took action against UnitedHealthcare's subsidiary PacifiCare Health Systems, acquired in 2005, ultimately fining UnitedHealthcare around $173\u00a0million for an estimated over 900,000 violations of the Unfair Insurance Practices Act; by 2019, the case was still being disputed in court, with the possibility of affirming $91\u00a0million in penalties.[122][needs update]CMS fine over Medicare Part D[edit]In 2017, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) fined UnitedHealthcare $2.5\u00a0million after discovering issues in Medicare Part D leading to delays or denials in a 2016 audit.[123]New Jersey fine in 2018[edit]In 2018, the New Jersey Department of Banking and Insurance fined UnitedHealthcare $2.5\u00a0million due to various compliance issues; this was the largest fine against a licensee in nine years.[124]Pennsylvania lawsuit[edit]In 2019, UnitedHealthcare paid a $1\u00a0million penalty to settle Pennsylvania regulators' allegations that the company violated state and federal laws when paying medical claims, particularly for patients seeking treatment for autism and substance use disorders. The regulators also compelled the company to pay restitution for wrongly denied or delayed claims and to spend $800,000 on an outreach campaign to notify consumers of their mental health and substance use disorder benefits.[125]Mental health treatment lawsuit[edit]As reported by openminds.com:\n.mw-parser-output .templatequote{overflow:hidden;margin:1em 0;padding:0 32px}.mw-parser-output .templatequotecite{line-height:1.5em;text-align:left;margin-top:0}@media(min-width:500px){.mw-parser-output .templatequotecite{padding-left:1.6em}}On September 13, 2019, three addiction and mental health treatment centers sued United Behavioral Health (UBH), UnitedHealthcare's mental health subsidiary. The centers alleged that UBH wrongfully denied $5\u00a0million in behavioral health treatment claims for self-insured and fully insured employer health plans for residential and outpatient treatment from 2011 to 2017. The case involves claims for 157 employer group health plan members, including children.[126]Policy Research ownership[edit]The Lewin Group is a policy research and consulting firm that provides an economic analysis of health care and human services issues and policies.[127] The organization has existed for about 40 years and has maintained a nonpartisan reputation through the many ownership changes that have occurred over that time.[127] The Lewin Group was purchased in 2007 by Ingenix, a subsidiary of UnitedHealth Group, but alleges editorial and analytical \"independence\" from UnitedHealth Group, its parent company.[127] The Lewin Group discloses its ownership in its reports and on its website. While the Lewin Group does not advocate for or against any legislation, both Democratic and Republican politicians frequently cite the firm's studies to argue for and against various U.S. healthcare reform proposals.[128] For example, Democratic Senator Ron Wyden uses Lewin Group estimates to cite the feasibility of his Healthy Americans Act.[129] Former U.S. Representative Eric Cantor, the former House Republican Whip, has referred to the organization as \"the nonpartisan Lewin Group\" in arguing against government-funded health insurance proposals.[citation needed]Several Lewin studies have been used to argue both for and against the inclusion of a public option in national health reform. Lewin clients who often cite its findings include The Commonwealth Fund, which, in 2009, held up a Lewin study it commissioned[130] to advocate for a public plan. The report showed that legislative proposals would achieve nearly universal coverage and \"estimated that a public plan could offer small businesses insurance that is at least 9 percent cheaper than current small-business policies.\"[131]However, the Lewin Group has acknowledged that clients sometimes choose to keep the results of studies they have commissioned private. Indeed, Lewin Group Vice President John Sheils told The Washington Post that \"sometimes studies come out that don't show exactly what the client wants to see. And in those instances, they have [the] option to bury the study.\"[132]Dispute with TeamHealth[edit]In late 2021, Tennessee-based physician network TeamHealth, a subsidiary of the private equity company Blackstone Inc., sued UnitedHealthcare in the 8th District Court of Clark County, Nevada, alleging the insurer underpaid claims to three of TeamHealth's Nevada-based affiliates. In November 2021, the jury unanimously found United guilty of \"oppression, fraud, and malice\" in its conduct and awarded TeamHealth $2.65\u00a0million in compensatory damages. In December, the jury reconvened to determine punitive damages and awarded TeamHealth $60\u00a0million. TeamHealth plans to pursue similar legal action against United and other insurers in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, New York, Florida, Oklahoma, and Texas.[133][134]Change Healthcare acquisition[edit]In February 2022, the United States Department of Justice sued to stop UnitedHealth Group's $8 billion acquisition of Change Healthcare, arguing that the deal would give UnitedHealth access to its competitors' data and ultimately push up healthcare costs. The Justice Department said that UnitedHealth knew that access to claims would give it a view into rival health plans at Humana, Anthem Inc, CVS Health, Aetna, and Cigna.[135] A U.S. judge rejected the department's bid in September. Following the completion of the acquisition in October 2022, the parties agreed that the appeal would be voluntarily dismissed, with no reasons provided by the Justice Department for dropping the appeal.[136]Medicare Advantage overbilling[edit]An October 2021 New York Times report identified UnitedHealth in a list of Medicare insurers accused of over-billing. According to the Inspector General, a whistleblower came forward, so the U.S. government went after UnitedHealth for over-billing Medicare. Executives at UnitedHealth Group told workers to mine old medical records for more illnesses, to identify diagnoses of serious diseases that might have never existed, inflating bills paid by the federal government's Medicare Advantage program.[137]A study by the Kaiser Family Foundation found that in 2021, Medicare Advantage programs provided insurers with double the gross margin than insurance for individuals, groups, or Medicaid Managed Care.[138][139]In July 2024, the Wall Street Journal concluded that UnitedHealth was the worst offender among private insurers who made dubious diagnoses in their clients in order to trigger large payments from the government's Medicare Advantage program. The patients often did not receive any treatment for those insurer-added diagnoses. The report, based on Medicare data obtained from the federal government under a research agreement, calculated that diagnoses added by UnitedHealth for diseases patients had never been treated for had yielded $8.7\u00a0billion in payments to the company in 2021 \u2013 over half of its net income of $17\u00a0billion for that year.[140]Foundations[edit]Foundations affiliated with UnitedHealth Group include the UnitedHealth Foundation (UHF) and the UnitedHealthcare Children's Foundation (UHCCF), both of which were established in 1999.[141]UHF pledged $100 million over ten years to fund scholarships and workforce development programs focused on increasing ethnic and racial diversity within the health care industry.[142] UHF's investment will support 10,000 physicians from underrepresented communities: 5,000 students with a primary care focus and 5,000 physicians who want to advance careers in mental health, nursing, midwifery and medicine.[143] The work of this fund is part of a broader initiative in which UnitedHealth Group has teamed up with nine organizations to provide scholarships to more than 3,000 students through the Diverse Scholars Initiative.[143]UHCCF administers grants to help pay for medical costs for families with coverage gaps. According to UHCCF, the foundation raises money for medical grants by selling gift items such as backpacks, books, cards, and games, some of which are created by children.[144]See also[edit]America's Health Rankings reports released annually (in conjunction with UnitedHealth Group's UnitedHealth Foundation) since 19902024 Change Healthcare ransomware attackKilling of Brian ThompsonnH PredictNotes[edit].mw-parser-output .reflist{margin-bottom:0.5em;list-style-type:decimal}@media screen{.mw-parser-output .reflist{font-size:90%}}.mw-parser-output .reflist .references{font-size:100%;margin-bottom:0;list-style-type:inherit}.mw-parser-output .reflist-columns-2{column-width:30em}.mw-parser-output .reflist-columns-3{column-width:25em}.mw-parser-output .reflist-columns{margin-top:0.3em}.mw-parser-output .reflist-columns ol{margin-top:0}.mw-parser-output .reflist-columns li{page-break-inside:avoid;break-inside:avoid-column}.mw-parser-output .reflist-upper-alpha{list-style-type:upper-alpha}.mw-parser-output .reflist-upper-roman{list-style-type:upper-roman}.mw-parser-output .reflist-lower-alpha{list-style-type:lower-alpha}.mw-parser-output .reflist-lower-greek{list-style-type:lower-greek}.mw-parser-output .reflist-lower-roman{list-style-type:lower-roman}^Also referred to as Rally.(.mw-parser-output cite.citation{font-style:inherit;word-wrap:break-word}.mw-parser-output .citation q{quotes:\"\\\"\"\"\\\"\"\"'\"\"'\"}.mw-parser-output .citation:target{background-color:rgba(0,127,255,0.133)}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-free.id-lock-free a{background:url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/65/Lock-green.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-limited.id-lock-limited a,.mw-parser-output .id-lock-registration.id-lock-registration a{background:url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d6/Lock-gray-alt-2.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-subscription.id-lock-subscription a{background:url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/aa/Lock-red-alt-2.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .cs1-ws-icon a{background:url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg\")right 0.1em center/12px no-repeat}body:not(.skin-timeless):not(.skin-minerva) .mw-parser-output .id-lock-free a,body:not(.skin-timeless):not(.skin-minerva) .mw-parser-output .id-lock-limited a,body:not(.skin-timeless):not(.skin-minerva) .mw-parser-output .id-lock-registration a,body:not(.skin-timeless):not(.skin-minerva) .mw-parser-output .id-lock-subscription a,body:not(.skin-timeless):not(.skin-minerva) .mw-parser-output .cs1-ws-icon a{background-size:contain;padding:0 1em 0 0}.mw-parser-output .cs1-code{color:inherit;background:inherit;border:none;padding:inherit}.mw-parser-output .cs1-hidden-error{display:none;color:var(--color-error,#d33)}.mw-parser-output .cs1-visible-error{color:var(--color-error,#d33)}.mw-parser-output .cs1-maint{display:none;color:#085;margin-left:0.3em}.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-left{padding-left:0.2em}.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-right{padding-right:0.2em}.mw-parser-output .citation .mw-selflink{font-weight:inherit}@media screen{.mw-parser-output .cs1-format{font-size:95%}html.skin-theme-clientpref-night .mw-parser-output .cs1-maint{color:#18911f}}@media screen and (prefers-color-scheme:dark){html.skin-theme-clientpref-os .mw-parser-output .cs1-maint{color:#18911f}}Staff (February 3, 2015). \"Rally Health Launches Digital Wellness Platform With Over 5M People\".

The ten largest shareholders as of December 2024:[137]The Vanguard Group (9.67%)BlackRock (8.36%)State Street Corporation (5.58%)Geode Capital Management (2.40%)Morgan Stanley (1.82%)JPMorgan Chase (1.61%)State Farm (1.32%)Northern Trust (1.28%)Norges Bank (1.26%)Wellington Management Group (1.01%)Environmental record[edit]Johnson & Johnson has set several positive goals to keep the company environmentally friendly and was ranked third among the United States's largest companies in Newsweek's \"Green Rankings\".[138] Some examples are the reduction in water use, waste, and energy use and an increased level of transparency.[139] Johnson & Johnson agreed to change its packaging of plastic bottles used in the manufacturing process, switching their packaging of liquids to non-polyvinyl chloride containers.[140] The corporation is working with the Climate Northwest Initiative and the EPA National Environmental Performance Track program.[141] As a member of the national Green Power Partnership, Johnson & Johnson operates the largest solar power generator in Pennsylvania at its site in Fort Washington, Pennsylvania.[142]Recalls and litigation[edit]1982 Chicago Tylenol murders[edit]Main article: Chicago Tylenol murdersOn September 29, 1982, a \"Tylenol scare\" began when the first of seven individuals died in Chicago metropolitan area, after ingesting Extra Strength Tylenol that had been deliberately laced with cyanide.[143] Within a week, the company pulled 31 million bottles of capsules back from retailers, making it one of the first major recalls in American history.[143] The incident led to reforms in the packaging of over-the-counter substances and to federal anti-tampering laws. The case remains unsolved and no suspects have been charged. Johnson & Johnson's quick response, including a nationwide recall, was widely praised by public relations experts and the media and was the gold standard for corporate crisis management.[144][145][146]2010 children's product recall[edit]Main article: 2010 Johnson & Johnson children's product recallOn April 30, 2010, McNeil Consumer Healthcare, a subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson, voluntarily recalled 43 over-the-counter children's medicines, including Tylenol, Tylenol Plus, Motrin, Zyrtec and Benadryl. The recall was conducted after a routine inspection at a manufacturing facility in Fort Washington, Pennsylvania, United States, revealed that some \"products may not fully meet the required manufacturing specifications\".[147][148] Affected products may contain a \"higher concentration of active ingredients\" or exhibit other manufacturing defects.[148] Products shipped to Canada, Dominican Republic, Mexico, Guam, Guatemala, Jamaica, Puerto Rico, Panama, Trinidad and Tobago, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait and Fiji were included in the recall.[147] In a statement, Johnson & Johnson said \"a comprehensive quality assessment across its manufacturing operations\" was underway.[147][148] A dedicated website was established by the company listing affected products and other consumer information.[148]2010 hip-replacement recall[edit]Main article: 2010 DePuy Hip RecallOn August 24, 2010, DePuy, a subsidiary of American giant Johnson & Johnson, recalled its ASR (articular surface replacement) hip prostheses from the market. DePuy said the recall was due to unpublished National Joint Registry data showing a 12% revision rate for resurfacing at five years and an ASR XL revision rate of 13%. All hip prostheses fail in some patients, but it is expected that the rate will be about 1% a year.[149]\nPathologically, the failing prosthesis had several effects. Metal debris from wear of the implant led to a reaction that destroyed the soft tissues surrounding the joint, leaving some patients with long term disability. Ions of cobalt and chromium\u00a0\u2013 the metals from which the implant was made\u00a0\u2013 were also released into the blood and cerebral spinal fluid in some patients.[150]In March 2013, a jury in Los Angeles ordered Johnson & Johnson to pay more than $8.3\u00a0million in damages to a Montana man in the first of more than 10,000 lawsuits pending against the company in connection with the now-recalled DePuy hip.[151]Some lawyers and industry analysts have estimated that the suits ultimately will cost Johnson & Johnson billions of dollars to resolve.[151]2010 Tylenol recall[edit]In 2010 and 2011, Johnson & Johnson voluntarily recalled some over-the-counter products, including Tylenol, due to an odor caused by tribromoanisole.[152][153] In this case, 2,4,6-tribromophenol was used to treat wooden pallets on which product packaging materials were transported and stored.[152]Shareholders lawsuit[edit]In 2010 a group of shareholders sued the board for allegedly failing to take action to prevent serious failings and illegalities since the 1990s, including manufacturing problems, bribing officials, covering up adverse effects and misleading marketing for unapproved uses. The judge initially dismissed the case in September 2011, but allowed the plaintiffs opportunity to refile at a later time.[154] In 2012 Johnson and Johnson proposed a settlement with the shareholders, whereby the company would institute new oversight, quality and compliance procedures binding for five years.[155]Illegal marketing of Risperdal[edit]Juries in several US states have found J&J guilty of concealing the adverse effects of Janssen Pharmaceuticals' antipsychotic medication Risperdal, produced by its unit, to promote it to doctors and patients as better than cheaper generics, and of falsely marketing it for treating patients with dementia.[156] States that have awarded damages include Texas ($158\u00a0million), South Carolina ($327\u00a0million), Louisiana ($258\u00a0million), and most notably Arkansas ($1.2\u00a0billion).[157]In 2010, the United States Department of Justice joined a whistleblowers suit accusing the company of illegally marketing Risperdal through Omnicare, the largest company supplying pharmaceuticals to nursing homes.[158][159] The allegations include that J&J were warned by the FDA to not promote Risperdal as effective and safe for elderly patients, but they did so, and that they paid Omnicare to promote the drug to care home physicians.[160] The settlement was finalized on November 4, 2013, with J&J agreeing to pay a penalty of around $2.2\u00a0billion, \"including criminal fines and forfeiture totaling $485\u00a0million and civil settlements with the federal government and states totaling $1.72\u00a0billion\".[161]Johnson & Johnson has also been subject to congressional investigations related to payments given to psychiatrists to promote its products and ghost write articles, notably Joseph Biederman and his pediatric bipolar disorder research unit.[162]Foreign bribery[edit]In 2011, J&J settled litigation brought by the US Securities and Exchange Commission under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and paid around $70M in disgorgement and fines.[163] J&J's employees had given kickbacks and bribes to doctors in Greece, Poland, and Romania to obtain business selling drugs and medical devices and had bribed officials in Iraq to win contracts under the Oil for Food program.[164] J&J fully cooperated with the investigation once the problems came to light.[165]Consumer fraud settlements[edit]In May 2017, J&J reached an agreement to pay $33\u00a0million to several states to settle consumer fraud allegations in some of the company's over-the-counter drugs.[166][167][168]Use of the Red Cross symbol[edit]Further information: Emblems of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement \u00a7\u00a0Use of the emblemsFlag of the Red CrossJohnson & Johnson registered the Red Cross as a U.S. trademark for \"medicinal and surgical plasters\" in 1905 and has used the design since 1887.[169] The Geneva Conventions, which reserved the Red Cross emblem for specific uses, were first approved in 1864 and ratified by the United States in 1882. However, the emblem was not protected by U.S. law for the use of the American Red Cross (ARC) and the U.S. military until after Johnson & Johnson had obtained its trademark. A clause in this law (now 18 U.S.C. 706) permits this pre-existing use of the Red Cross to continue.[170][171][172]A declaration made by the U.S. upon its ratification of the 1949 Geneva Conventions includes a reservation that pre-1905 U.S. domestic uses of the Red Cross, such as Johnson & Johnson's, would remain lawful as long as the cross is not used on \"aircraft, vessels, vehicles, buildings or other structures, or upon the ground\", i.e., uses which could be confused with its military uses.[173] This means that the U.S. did not agree to any interpretation of the 1949 Geneva Conventions that would overrule Johnson & Johnson's trademark. The American Red Cross continues to recognize the validity of Johnson & Johnson's trademark.[174]In August 2007, Johnson & Johnson filed a lawsuit against the ARC, demanding that the charity halt the use of the red cross symbol on products it sells to the public, though the company takes no issue with the charity's use of the mark for nonprofit purposes.[175] In May 2008, the judge in the case dismissed most of Johnson & Johnson's claims, and a month later the two organizations announced a settlement had been reached in which both parties would continue to use the symbol.[176]Boston Scientific lawsuits[edit]Since 2003, Johnson & Johnson and Boston Scientific have both claimed that the other had infringed on their patents covering heart stent medical devices. The litigation was settled when Boston Scientific agreed to pay $716\u00a0million to Johnson & Johnson in September 2009 and an additional $1.73\u00a0billion in February 2010.[177] Their dispute was renewed in 2014, now on the grounds of a contract dispute.[178]Patent-infringement case against Abbott[edit]In 2007, Johnson & Johnson sued Abbott Laboratories over the development and sale of the arthritis drug Humira, claiming Abbott used technology licensed exclusively to Johnson & Johnson's Centocor division. Johnson & Johnson won the court case, and in 2009 Abbott was ordered to pay Johnson & Johnson $1.17\u00a0billion in lost revenues and $504\u00a0million in royalties.[179] The judge also added $175.6\u00a0million in interest to bring the total to $1.84\u00a0billion.[180] This was the largest patent-infringement award in U.S. history[179] until the 2013 decision against Teva in favor of Takeda and Pfizer for over $2.1\u00a0billion.[181] In 2010 Abbott appealed the verdict[180] and in 2011 won the appeal.[182]Vaginal mesh implants[edit]Tens of thousands of women worldwide have taken legal action against Johnson & Johnson after suffering serious complications following a vaginal mesh implant procedure.[183] In Australia, more than 700 women began a class action against the company in the Federal Court of Australia in 2017, telling the court they \"suffered irreparable, debilitating pain after the devices began to erode into surrounding tissue and organs, causing infections and complications\". The class action alleged that Johnson & Johnson, which \"aggressively marketed\" the implants \"failed to properly warn patients and surgeons of the risk, or test the devices adequately\".[184] Emails between executives show the company was aware of the risks in 2005 but still went ahead and made the product available.[185] In November 2019 the Federal Court of Australia found Johnson & Johnson negligent.[186] The judgment was appealed, with the appeals court upholding all findings of Justice Anna Katzman.[187] Ethicon then sought a High Court decision but this was not permitted by the High Court of Australia. Subsequently (September 2022) a A$300,000,000 compensation agreement was reached between Shine Lawyers and J&J but this agreement remains subject to approval by the Federal Court of Australia.[186]In the US in 2016 the U.S. states of California and Washington filed a lawsuit against the company, accusing it of deception.[183] In October 2019, the company and its subsidiary, Ethicon, Inc. reached a settlement with 41 states and the District of Columbia, with no admission of liability, in a suit alleging deceptive marketing of transvaginal surgical-mesh devices. The suit also alleges that the company failed to disclose risks associated with the product, which J&J pulled from the US market in 2012. The amount settled in the suit was about $117\u00a0million.[188]Baby powder[edit]J&J has been the subject of over 60,000 lawsuits claiming that its baby powder causes ovarian cancer.[189] The lawsuits focus on claims that the talc-based powder is contaminated with asbestos, a known carcinogen commonly found in places where talc is mined.[190]In 2016, J&J was ordered to pay $72\u00a0million in damages to the family of Jacqueline Fox, a 62-year-old woman who died of ovarian cancer in 2015. The company said it would appeal.[191] A year later, over 1,000 U.S. women had sued J&J for covering up the possible cancer risk from its Baby Powder product. The company says that 70% of its Baby Powder is used by adults.[192] Later that year, a California jury ordered Johnson & Johnson to pay $417\u00a0million to a woman who claimed she developed ovarian cancer after using the company's talc-based products like Johnson's Baby Powder for feminine hygiene. The verdict included $70\u00a0million in compensatory damages and $347\u00a0million in punitive damages. J&J said they would appeal the verdict.[193] The Missouri Eastern District appeals court later negated a $72\u00a0million jury verdict in the Jacqueline Fox lawsuit, ruling it lacked jurisdiction in Missouri because of a U.S. Supreme Court decision that imposed limits on where injury lawsuit can be filed. Subsequently, this ruling killed three other recent St. Louis jury verdicts of more than $200\u00a0million combined. Fox, 62, of Birmingham, Alabama, died in 2015, about four months before her trial was held in St. Louis Circuit Court. She was among 65 plaintiffs, of whom only two were from Missouri.[194]A St. Louis jury awarded nearly $4.7\u00a0billion in damages to 22 women and their families in 2018 after they claimed that asbestos in Johnson & Johnson talcum powder caused their ovarian cancer.[195] In August, J&J said that it removed several chemicals from baby powder products and re-engineered them to make consumers more confident that products were safer for children.[196] The company was forced to release internal documents with 11,700 people suing J&J over cancers allegedly caused by baby powder. The documents showed that the company had known about asbestos contamination since at least as early as 1971 and had spent decades finding ways to conceal the evidence from the public.[197]The company lost its request to reverse a jury verdict that ruled in favor of the accusers, which required the company to pay $4.14\u00a0billion in punitive damages and $550\u00a0million in compensatory damages.[198] A large study performed in 2003 found that ovarian cancer risk increased from a baseline of 0.0121% to 0.0161% in people who reported regularly using talc in the genital area. Two more studies over the next twelve years, which also relied on self-reporting, had similar results; however, none of the three studies showed a relationship between how long someone used talc and how much their cancer risk increased, which is expected in experiments with carcinogens and other toxic substances (see dose\u2013response relationship).[199]Conversely, a St. Louis jury ruled in favor of Johnson & Johnson in the case of a single plaintiff who had used the company's talc-containing baby powder for thirty years with a similar claim.[200] The company's CEO, Alex Gorsky, declined to appear at a United States congressional hearing on the safety of J&J's Baby Powder and other talc-based cosmetics. J&J spokesman Ernie Knewitz said that the subcommittee had rejected the company's offers to send a talc testing expert or a J&J executive in charge of consumer products.[201] In response to declining demand, J&J announced it would discontinue the sale of talc-based baby powder in the United States and Canada in 2020, but would continue to sell it in other markets. In a statement, the company said that the existing retail inventory of the talc-based powder will sell until it runs out, while the company's cornstarch-based baby powder will continue to sell in the United States and Canada.[202]The Supreme Court of Missouri refused to consider J&J's appeal of a $2.12\u00a0billion damages award to women who blamed their ovarian cancer on its talc-based products.[203][204]The Supreme Court of the United States also refused to consider an appeal from J&J, leaving in place a judgment from a state appeal court that had cut the original award to $2.1\u00a0billion.[205] Two of the justices had to recuse: Samuel Alito because either he and/or his wife owning or recently owning stock in J&J, and Brett Kavanaugh, whose father led an industry group lobbying against safety warnings on talc products. Representing the affected women during the trial, Mark Lanier remarked that the Supreme Court's decision sent \"a clear message to the rich and powerful: You will be held to account when you cause grievous harm under our system of equal justice under law.\"[206][207] J&J had argued that the combined claims in the St. Louis trial were too different, yet the short jury deliberation and identical payouts were, therefore, a violation of the company's due process and also that the high punitive award was unconstitutional.[190]In 2021, Johnson & Johnson subsidiary LTL Management LLC, using a process called a Texas divisional merger, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in North Carolina. The process allowed by Texas law lets a company create a separate subsidiary to take over liabilities, with the existing company operating normally. The new company, with a different name, can locate in a state such as North Carolina where bankruptcy laws are different, and then declare bankruptcy, paying less than the original company would have. In the case of LTL, a $2\u00a0billion trust will be created, compared to $25\u00a0billion if Johnson & Johnson had declared bankruptcy. According to the filing, a company known as Old JJCI took on the baby powder related liabilities in 1979, while Johnson & Johnson remained a defendant. LTL and New JJCI were created with LTL taking the baby powder related liabilities and some assets, and New JJCI taking the remaining assets. Johnson & Johnson says LTL is now based in New Jersey.[208][209]The company announced that it would stop making talc-based powder by 2023 and replace it with cornstarch-based powders. The company says the talc-based powder is safe to use and does not contain asbestos.[210]Lawsuits showed connections between Johnson & Johnson and the Holmesburg Prison experiments.[211][212][213][214]In 2023, the number of lawsuits regarding talc-based baby powder exceeded 40,000 as more claimants came forward to say that the company's product caused them to have cancer. Johnson & Johnson offered $9\u00a0billion to settle all the lawsuits against the company, up from the previous figure of $2\u00a0billion.[215]In February 2025, as the number of talc-based powder related lawsuits sits at over 62,000, Johnson & Johnson offered a settlement of $10 billion to end litigation, funded by a subsidiary's filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, reliant on the approval from Houston bankruptcy judge, Judge Christopher Lopez. While the proposal showed significantly more support compared to their last bankruptcy attempts, there are accusations of the company pushing against negative votes, and widely accepting positive ones. Adam Silverstein, an attorney representing plaintiffs rejecting the proposal, branded the move as a \"blatant double standard\" in a statement to Lopez.[216]Opioid epidemic[edit]Further information: Opioid epidemic in the United StatesBy 2018, the company had become embroiled in the opioid epidemic in the United States and had become a target of lawsuits.[217][218] Over 500 opioid-related cases have been filed as of May 2018 against J&J and its competitors.[219] In Idaho, J&J is part of a lawsuit accusing the company for being partially to blame for opioid-related overdose deaths.[220] The first major trial began in Oklahoma in May 2019.[221] On August 26, 2019, the Oklahoma judge ordered J&J to pay $572\u00a0million for their part in the opioid crisis,[222] and in October J&J paid $20.4\u00a0million to two Ohio counties fighting the opioid epidemic.[223] In January 2022, Johnson & Johnson agreed to pay up to $5\u00a0billion as part of a $26\u00a0billion settlement which included McKesson, AmerisourceBergen, and Cardinal Health.[224] Had the states gone to court, the companies could have faced up to $95\u00a0billion in penalties.[225]Northeastern Ohio Settlement[edit]In October 2019, the company agreed to a settlement of $20.4\u00a0million with northeasternOhio's most populous counties of Cuyahoga (containing Cleveland) and Summit (Akron). The settlement allows the company avoidance of a trial accusing J&J and many other pharmaceutical manufacturers of helping to spark the US opioid epidemic. The trial was thought to be an indicator for thousands of opioid-related lawsuits against many drug manufacturers.

It is ranked sixth on the list of largest biomedical companies by revenue. In 2023, the company's seat in Forbes Global 2000 was 74,[2] and rank 89 on the 2024 list.[3] The company's primary product is Humira (adalimumab) ($14\u00a0billion in 2023 revenues, 27\u00a0percent of total), administered via injection. It is approved to treat autoimmune diseases including rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease, plaque psoriasis, and ulcerative colitis.\nIt developed Skyrizi ($7.8\u00a0billion in 2023 revenues), an interleukin-23 (IL-23) inhibitor also used to treat autoimmune diseases. Its other major products include Botox ($5.7\u00a0billion in 2023 revenues), Imbruvica to treat cancer ($3.6\u00a0billion in 2023 revenues), Rinvoq to treat arthritis ($4\u00a0billion in 2023 revenues), Venclexta to treat leukemia and lymphoma ($2.3\u00a0billion in 2023 revenues), Vraylar to treat schizophrenia and bipolar disorder ($2.7\u00a0billion in 2023 revenues), and Mavyret to treat Hepatitis C ($1.4\u00a0billion in 2023 revenues).[4]:\u200a39\u201340\u200a The company is also committed to product development for other treatments of cancer, neurologic diseases, eye care, and cystic fibrosis.[4]:\u200a34\u200a[5]In 2023, Humira began facing competition from a biosimilar developed by Amgen. The company is also developing a drug for Parkinson's disease that could be a blockbuster drug in 2027 and is awaiting approval from the Food and Drug Administration for epcoritamab, a blood-cancer therapy under development in partnership with Genmab.[6]The name \"AbbVie\" is derived from a combination of \"Abbott\", the name of its former parent company, with \"vie\", intended as a reference to a Latin root meaning 'life'.[7]History[edit]On October 19, 2011, Abbott Laboratories announced its plan to separate into two publicly traded companies, spinning off its research-based pharmaceutical manufacturer division.[8] This spin-off company, named AbbVie, was formed on April 10, 2012.[9] The separation was fully effective January 1, 2013, and AbbVie was officially listed on the New York Stock Exchange (ABBV) on January 2, 2013.[10][11]In March 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, the Israeli government announced that it would force AbbVie to license its patents for Kaletra, the brand name of lopinavir/ritonavir, a fixed dose combination medication for the treatment and prevention of HIV/AIDS which was also thought to have some applicability to fighting COVID-19. In response, AbbVie announced that it would cease enforcing its patents on the drug entirely.[12]Acquisitions[edit]In January 2014, the company acquired ImmuVen.[13] On September 3, 2014, AbbVie and Infinity Pharmaceuticals  entered into a global collaboration to develop and commercialize duvelisib, Infinity's PI3K inhibitor for the treatment of patients with cancer. On the same day, AbbVie and Calico entered into a R&D collaboration intended to discover, develop and bring to market new therapies for patients with diseases of aging including neurodegeneration and cancer. California Life Company, operating as Calico, is an Alphabet Inc. subsidiary focused on aging and age-related diseases, and led by former Genentech chairman and CEO of Arthur D. Levinson and former Genentech EVP and chief medical officerHal V. Barron (who subsequently left the company).[14]In October 2014, AbbVie ended its efforts to acquire Shire, which would have been one of the largest M&A deals of that year and one of the largest tax inversions in history, due to changes in the US tax code by the US Treasury; AbbVie had to pay a $1.6 billion breakup fee.[15]On March 4, 2015, AbbVie announced its agreement to acquire oncology firm Pharmacyclics and its treatment for blood cancers, ibrutinib; AstraZeneca had also been bidding to acquire Pharmacyclics.[16][17] Under the terms of the transaction, AbbVie agreed to pay $261.25 per share as a mix of cash and AbbVie equity. The acquisition valued at approximately $21 billion was completed on May 26, 2015.[18] The Pharmacyclics name was retained, and it operated as a subsidiary of AbbVie from its previous Sunnyvale, California headquarters until the consolidation of AbbVie Bay Area sites in a new building in South San Francisco.[19] On June 3, 2015, AbbVie and Halozyme Therapeutics announced that they had entered into a global collaboration and licensing agreement to develop and commercialize products that combine AbbVie's treatments and Halozyme's ENHANZE drug-delivery technology, this was terminated in November 2016.[20]On 28 April 2016, the company announced it would acquire Stemcentrx for up to $9.8 billion.[21] A day later, the company announced an expansion of a two and a half-year-old cystic fibrosis deal with Galapagos NV, potentially doubling milestone payments to $600 million.[22][23]On 25 June 2019, AbbVie announced it would acquire Irish-based Allergan plc for about $63 billion; however the transaction would not be structured as a tax inversion, and that post the transaction, AbbVie would remain legally domiciled in the U.S. for tax purposes.[24][25] The company divested certain assets to gain FTC approval.[26][27]In July 2019, the company announced it would acquire Mavupharma, boosting its cancer drug pipeline.[28][29]In May 2021, Allergan Aesthetics announced the acquisition of Soliton.[30] In June, Abbvie acquired TeneoOne and its lead compound TNB-383B. The compound is a BCMA-targeting immunotherapeutic for relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma.[31]In March 2022, AbbVie acquired Syndesi Therapeutics for up to $1 billion and its portfolio of novel modulators of the synaptic vesicle protein 2A and lead compound SDI-118.[32][33] In October, the company acquired DJS Antibodies for $225 million, giving it access to an experimental drug for an aggressive lung disease as well as technology to develop certain antibody medicines.[34]In November 2023, AbbVie announced it would be buying ImmunoGen for $10.1 billion, aiming to expedite its entry into the ovarian cancer treatment market with ImmunoGen's drug Elahere. The deal, which is subject to approval by ImmunoGen shareholders and regulators, was finalized in February 2024.[35][36]In December 2023, AbbVie announced that it will acquire neuroscience drugmaker Cerevel Therapeutics for $8.7 billion, in an attempt to expand its drug pipeline.[37] The acquisition was completed in August 2024.[38]On June 1, 2024, AbbVie's current President and Chief Operating Officer (COO) Robert Michael replaced Richard Gonzalez as CEO of AbbVie. Gonzalez will be the executive chairman.[39]In February 2024, AbbVie Inc. and Tentarix Biotherapeutics announced the beginning of a long-term collaboration in the discovery and development of opportunistic, multi-specific biological candidates in oncology and immunology. AbbVie provides expertise in these areas, and will also provide Tentarix with option advances worth $64 million for two programs, and Tentarix will provide its patented Tentarix Tentacles\u2122platform. AbbVie will receive an exclusive option to purchase the software in full, but the amount of the additional payment is not disclosed.[40] In March of the same year the company announced it would acquire Landos Biopharma for over $200 million.[41]On Sept 9, 2024 AbbVie has filed a lawsuit against cancer treatment maker BeiGene alleging that it had encouraged their former scientist Huaqing Liu\u2019s trade secrets.The company had spent years of research and investments to develop a compound that could have treated a certain type of blood and bone marrow cancers related to the growth of \u201cB cells\u201d.[42] \nIn October 2024, AbbVie acquired Aliada Therapeutics for $1.4bn to expand its neuroscience pipeline.[43] \nIn December 2024, AbbVie bought Nimble Therapeutics, a Roche spinout working to develop oral peptide treatments in the autoimmune area, for $200 million.[44]Acquisition history[edit].mw-parser-output .hidden-begin{box-sizing:border-box;width:100%;padding:5px;border:none;font-size:95%}.mw-parser-output .hidden-title{font-weight:bold;line-height:1.6;text-align:left}.mw-parser-output .hidden-content{text-align:left}@media all and (max-width:500px){.mw-parser-output .hidden-begin{width:auto!important;clear:none!important;float:none!important}}The following is an illustration of the company's major mergers and acquisitions and historical predecessors (this is not a comprehensive list):.mw-parser-output .treeview ul{padding:0;margin:0}.mw-parser-output .treeview li{padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none;list-style-image:none}.mw-parser-output .treeview li li{background:url(\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f2/Treeview-grey-line.png\")no-repeat 0 -2981px;padding-left:21px;text-indent:0.3em}.mw-parser-output .treeview li li:last-child{background-position:0 -5971px}.mw-parser-output .treeview li.emptyline>ul>.mw-empty-elt:first-child+.emptyline,.mw-parser-output .treeview li.emptyline>ul>li:first-child{background-position:0 9px}Abbvie(Spin off from Abbott Laboratories)Pharmacyclics(Acq 2015)Stemcentrx (Acq 2016)Venice Subsidiary LLC[45]Allergan, plc(Acq 2019)Allergan, incMAP Pharmaceuticals Inc (Acq 2013)Kythera Biopharmaceuticals (Acq 2015)Actavis plcEden BiodesignWatson PharmaceuticalsWarner Chilcott Plc (Acq 2000)Andrx Corporation (Acq 2006)Procter & Gamble (Prescription drug div, Acq 2009)Arrow Group (Acq 2009)Specifar Pharmaceuticals S.A.

Synlogic is a synthetic biology company built on research from the labs of James Collins and Tim Lu at MIT. As part of the collaboration, AbbVie is getting worldwide rights to Synlogic's probiotic-based technology for treating inflammatory bowel disease, and the research teams will focus on Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis.[46] In April 2016, the company partnered with the University of Chicago to investigate a number of areas of oncology: breast, lung, prostate, colorectal and hematological cancers.[47] In the same month the company announced it would co-commercialize Argenx's preclinical immunotherapy, ARGX-115. ARGX-115 is a first-in-class immunotherapy targeting GARP (glycoprotein A repetitions predominant), a membrane protein believed to enhance the immunosuppressive effects of T cells.[48] The company also announced a deal to co-develop/commercialize at least one of CytomX Probody's conjugates against CD71 (transferrin receptor 1).[49]In March 2020, AbbVie announced plans to evaluate the Kaletra/Aluvia HIV medicine as possible COVID-19 treatment. The company entered into various partnerships with health authorities in different countries to investigate the efficacy of the medication.[50] However, the first non-blinded, randomized trial found the drug not useful to treat severe COVID-19.[51]Controversies[edit]Drug pricing[edit]First released in 2003, AbbVie has since raised the price of Humira by more than 470%, culminating in an annual supply costing about $77,000. It has increased the price of Imbruvica, a drug used to treat mantle cell lymphoma and other cancers, by 82% since it launched in 2013. In 2022, it was priced at $181,529. For patients taking four pills each day, the cost was  $242,039.[52]According to the Wall Street Journal, as of January 2016 ibrutinib, a specialty drug, cost US$116,600 to $155,400 a year wholesale in the United States. In spite of discounts and medical insurance, the prohibitive price causes some patients to not fill their prescriptions.[53] AbbVie estimated global sales of the drug at $1 billion in 2016 and $5 billion in 2020.[53]Anti-competitive practices[edit]AbbVie has  been accused of using anti-competitive patent thickets to prevent potentially cheaper biosimilars from entering the market. It is currently caught up in a legislative battle against Icelandic Alvotech, which is trying to bring a Humira biosimilar to market.[54][55]Forest Laboratories, a subsidiary of AbbVie, has been accused of using unlawful deals to prevent generic versions of its Alzheimer's disease drug,   Namenda, from entering the market.[56][57]In 2018, AbbVie agreed to pay $25 million to resolve allegations that it made use of kickback schemes to promote its cholesterol drug Tricor.[58] In 2020, AbbVie agreed to pay $24M to resolve allegations that it made use of kickback schemes to promote its rheumatoid arthritis drug Humira using \"nurse ambassadors\".[59][60]Tax avoidance[edit]In June 2021, the United States Senate Finance Committee, under Chair Ron Wyden (D-OR), began an investigation to determine if the company used the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 to buy back its own stock using income saved by the tax law.[61] In a letter to AbbVie CEO Richard Gonzalez, Wyden noted the company suffered a 2020 pretax loss in the US of $4.5 billion and an overseas pretax profit of $7.9 billion the same year. Wyden accused the company of shifting revenue to avoid US taxes.[62]Marketing of opioid painkillers[edit]In July 2022 the company agreed to pay up to $2.37 billion to settle U.S. lawsuits against its Allergan unit over the marketing of opioidpainkillers.  As part of the settlement, AbbVie, denied any wrongdoing.  The company's stock fell 6 percent following an earnings report that included a $2.2 billion charge related to the opioid deal.[63]Litigation by the company against the NHS[edit]In 2018, it started litigation against NHS England in the Technology and Construction Court claiming that the agency breached procurement rules and had not treated the company fairly during what was described as \"the single largest medicines procurement ever done by the NHS\" when seeking suppliers for hepatitis C treatments.[64] In 2019, a UK court dismissed AbbVie's case against the NHS.[65]Carbon footprint[edit]AbbVie reported Total CO2e emissions (Direct + Indirect) for the twelve months ending 31 December 2020 at 508 Kt (\u221257 /-10.1% y-o-y).[66] and plans to reduce  emissions 25% by 2025 from a 2015 base year.[67]AbbVie's annual Total CO2e Emissions \u2013 Market-Based Scope 1 + Scope 2 (in kilotonnes)\nDec 2014Dec 2015Dec 2016Dec 2017Dec 2018Dec 2019Dec 2020\n679[68]654[69]610[70]583[71]585[72]565[73]508[66]References[edit].mw-parser-output .reflist{margin-bottom:0.5em;list-style-type:decimal}@media screen{.mw-parser-output .reflist{font-size:90%}}.mw-parser-output .reflist .references{font-size:100%;margin-bottom:0;list-style-type:inherit}.mw-parser-output .reflist-columns-2{column-width:30em}.mw-parser-output .reflist-columns-3{column-width:25em}.mw-parser-output .reflist-columns{margin-top:0.3em}.mw-parser-output .reflist-columns ol{margin-top:0}.mw-parser-output .reflist-columns li{page-break-inside:avoid;break-inside:avoid-column}.mw-parser-output .reflist-upper-alpha{list-style-type:upper-alpha}.mw-parser-output .reflist-upper-roman{list-style-type:upper-roman}.mw-parser-output .reflist-lower-alpha{list-style-type:lower-alpha}.mw-parser-output .reflist-lower-greek{list-style-type:lower-greek}.mw-parser-output .reflist-lower-roman{list-style-type:lower-roman}^.mw-parser-output cite.citation{font-style:inherit;word-wrap:break-word}.mw-parser-output .citation q{quotes:\"\\\"\"\"\\\"\"\"'\"\"'\"}.mw-parser-output .citation:target{background-color:rgba(0,127,255,0.133)}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-free.id-lock-free a{background:url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/65/Lock-green.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-limited.id-lock-limited a,.mw-parser-output .id-lock-registration.id-lock-registration a{background:url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d6/Lock-gray-alt-2.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-subscription.id-lock-subscription a{background:url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/aa/Lock-red-alt-2.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .cs1-ws-icon a{background:url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg\")right 0.1em center/12px no-repeat}body:not(.skin-timeless):not(.skin-minerva) .mw-parser-output .id-lock-free a,body:not(.skin-timeless):not(.skin-minerva) .mw-parser-output .id-lock-limited a,body:not(.skin-timeless):not(.skin-minerva) .mw-parser-output .id-lock-registration a,body:not(.skin-timeless):not(.skin-minerva) .mw-parser-output .id-lock-subscription a,body:not(.skin-timeless):not(.skin-minerva) .mw-parser-output .cs1-ws-icon a{background-size:contain;padding:0 1em 0 0}.mw-parser-output .cs1-code{color:inherit;background:inherit;border:none;padding:inherit}.mw-parser-output .cs1-hidden-error{display:none;color:var(--color-error,#d33)}.mw-parser-output .cs1-visible-error{color:var(--color-error,#d33)}.mw-parser-output .cs1-maint{display:none;color:#085;margin-left:0.3em}.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-left{padding-left:0.2em}.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-right{padding-right:0.2em}.mw-parser-output .citation .mw-selflink{font-weight:inherit}@media screen{.mw-parser-output .cs1-format{font-size:95%}html.skin-theme-clientpref-night .mw-parser-output .cs1-maint{color:#18911f}}@media screen and (prefers-color-scheme:dark){html.skin-theme-clientpref-os .mw-parser-output .cs1-maint{color:#18911f}}\"2024 Annual Report (Form 10-K)\".

The company was founded by Chicago physician Wallace Calvin Abbott in 1888 to formulate known drugs; today, it sells medical devices, diagnostics, branded generic medicines and nutritional products. It split off its research-based pharmaceuticals business into AbbVie in 2013.[4][5]Abbott's products include Pedialyte, Similac, BinaxNOW, Ensure, Glucerna, ZonePerfect, FreeStyle Libre, i-STAT and MitraClip.\nHistory[edit]Dr. Wallace C. AbbottFoundation and early history[edit]See also: Dr. Wallace C. Abbott HouseIn 1888 at the age of 30, Wallace Abbott (1857\u20131921), an 1885 graduate of the University of Michigan, founded the Abbott Alkaloidal Company in Ravenswood, Chicago. At the time, he was a practising physician and owned a drug store. His innovation was formulating the active part of alkaloid  medicinal plants\u2014morphine, quinine, strychnine and codeine\u2014as tiny \"dosimetric granules\", producing more consistent and effective dosages for patients than the liquid preparations previously used, which deteriorated over time.[6] In 1922, the company moved from Ravenswood to North Chicago, Illinois.[citation needed]International expansion[edit]Abbott's first international affiliate was in London in 1907; the company later added an affiliate in Montreal, Canada.[citation needed] Abbott India Ltd was originally incorporated on August 22, 1944, as Boots Pure Drug Company (India) Ltd. The company name was changed to The Boots Company (India) Ltd on November 1, 1971, and to Boots Pharmaceuticals Ltd on January 1, 1991. On October 31, 1995, the name was changed to Knoll Pharmaceuticals Ltd and on July 1, 2002, to their present name Abbott India Ltd. Abbott started operations in Pakistan as a marketing affiliate in 1948; the company has steadily expanded to comprise a work force of over 1500 employees. Currently, two manufacturing facilities located at Landhi and Korangi in Karachi continue to produce pharmaceutical products.[7] In 1962  Abbott entered into a joint venture with Dainippon Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., of Osaka, Japan, to manufacture radio-pharmaceuticals.[citation needed] In 1964, it merged with Ross Laboratories, making Ross a wholly owned subsidiary of Abbott, and Richard Ross gained a seat on Abbott's board of directors until his retirement in 1983.[8] The acquisition of Ross brought Similac under the Abbott umbrella. In the years following the acquisition, Pedialyte and Ensure were introduced as nutritional products by Ross Laboratories while under Abbott's leadership.[9][10][11]In 1965, Abbott's expansion in Europe continued with offices in Italy and France.[citation needed]According to Harvard professor Lester Grinspoon and Peter Hedblom, \"In 1966 Abbott Laboratories sold the equivalent of two million doses of methamphetamine in powder form to a Long Island criminal dealer\".[12]In 1985, Abbott partnered with the Japanese company Taisho Pharmaceutical for the international rights to clarithromycin, a second-generation macrolideantibiotic, and gained FDA approval for the drug under the brand name Biaxin in October 1991. The drug went generic in Europe in 2004 and in the US in mid-2005,[13] and has been added to the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines.[14]21st century[edit]In 2001, the company acquired Knoll, the pharmaceutical division of BASF, for $6.9\u00a0billion.[15] In 2002, it divested the Selsun Blue brand to Chattem.[16] Later in 2002, it sold Clear Eyes and Murine brands to Prestige Brands.[17] In 2004,  it acquired TheraSense, a diabetes-care company, which it merged with its MediSense division to become Abbott Diabetes Care.[18][additional citation(s) needed] In 2006, Abbott assisted Boston Scientific in its purchase of Guidant Corporation purchasing the vascular device division of Guidant.[19][20]In 2007, Abbott acquired Kos Pharmaceuticals for $3.7 billion in cash.[21] At the time of acquisition Kos marketed Niaspan (extended release niacin), and Advicor (niacin/lovastatin).\nIn 2007 the company was to sell two diagnostics divisions to General Electric, but the parties did not agree on the terms of the acquisition.[22]On 8 September 2007, the company sold the UK manufacturing plant at Queenborough to UK manufacturer Aesica Pharmaceuticals.[23][24]Abbott's Ross Products was renamed Abbott Nutrition in 2007.[25]In 2009 Abbott acquired Advanced Medical Optics of Santa Ana, California, selling it to Johnson & Johnson in 2017.[26] In 2009, Abbott opened a satellite research and development facility at Research Park, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.[27]In February 2010, Abbott acquired the pharmaceuticals unit of Solvay S.A. for US$6.2 billion (\u20ac4.5 billion),[28] gaining many additional pharmaceutical products and an increased presence in emerging markets.[29]In 2010 the company acquired Hollywood, Florida-based laboratory information management system company STARLIMS for $123 million, $14 per share.[30][31] That year Abbott said it would buy Piramal Healthcare of India's large generic drugs unit for $3.72 billion.[32][33]Spin-offs[edit]In 2004, Abbott spun off its hospital products division into a new 14,000 employee company, Hospira,[34] which was acquired by Pfizer in 2015.[35]In October 2011, Abbott planned to separate into two companies, one for research-based pharmaceuticals (AbbVie) and the other for medical devices, generic drugs sold internationally, and diagnostics, with the latter retaining the Abbott name.[36][37] Abbott Nutrition, whose products include Similac, Pedialyte, Glucerna, and Ensure, also retained the Abbott name.[36] In preparation for the reorganization, Abbott made severe budget cuts and took a $478 million charge in Q3-2012.[38] The separation was effective as of 1 January 2013, and AbbVie was listed in the New York Stock Exchange.[39]Further developments[edit]On 16 May 2014, it was announced that Abbott would acquire the holding company Kalo Pharma Internacional S.L. for $2.9 billion in order to secure the 73% it held of Chilean pharmaceutical company, CFR Pharmaceuticals, which the company said would more than double its branded generic drug portfolio.[40][41][42]In December 2014, the company acquired Russian pharmaceutical manufacturer Veropharm (Voronezh) in a deal worth $410 million, which included three manufacturing facilities.[40][43] Abbott, which already employed 1,400 people in Russia, said it planned to set up a manufacturing presence in the country when the deal closed.[44]In September 2015, the company announced it had completed its acquisition of Tendyne Holdings, Inc., a private medical device company focused on developing minimally invasive mitral valve replacement therapies.[45] Tendyne was acquired for a total transaction value of $250 million.[45] In January 2020, the Tendyne Mitral Valve became the world's first commercially available solution for Mitral Valve Replacement Technology.[citation needed] Abbott obtained CE Mark for the device which now makes it possible to implant it in Europe outside of a clinical setting. The US clinical study for federal approval is still ongoing.[46]In February 2016, the company announced it would acquire Alere for $5.8 billion.[47][48] In January 2017, Abbott announced it would acquire St. Jude Medical for $25 billion (each share receiving $46.75 in cash & 0.8708 shares of Abbott common stock, equating to an approximate value of $85).[40][49][50] On 3 October 2017, the company closed the Alere acquisition making the surviving entity the market leader player in the $7 billion point-of-care diagnostic space within the broader $50 billion in-vitro diagnostics market with this takeover.[51] With the acquisition of Alere, the company also obtained the subsidiary Arriva Medical, which is the largest mail-order diabetic supplier.[citation needed] Arriva Medical announced business closure after Abbott acquisition effective 31 December 2017.[52]In 2017, the FDA approved Abbott's FreeStyle Libre glucose monitoring system, which reads glucose levels through a self-applied sensor without finger pricks.[53]In August 2018, Reuters reported that Abbott Laboratories was among the top five companies for branded generic drugs in Russia.[54]Nucleic acid testing for COVID-19 conducted using an Abbott Laboratories ID Now deviceIn November 2018, Abbott received United States FDA clearance for FreeStyle LibreLink, a glucose reader smartphone app.[55]In January 2019 purchased Cephea Valve Technologies, Inc. which is developing a less-invasive replacement heart valve for people with mitral valve disease.[56]In March 2020, Abbott received emergency use authorization (EUA) from the US FDA for a SARS-CoV-2 test during the COVID-19 pandemic.[57] The tester is small (comparable to a small toaster), and produces results within 13 minutes.[58] Detroit received these tests on April 1, 2020.[59][60] Also in March, the firm received EUA for a molecular COVID-19 test that runs on its m2000 RealTime lab-based platform.[61] In April 2020, itt received EUA from the FDA for its third COVID-19 test, an antibody test that helps detect the IgG antibody to SARS-CoV-2 using the company's ARCHITECT laboratory instruments.[62] In May 2020, it received EUA from the FDA for another lab-based COVID-19 antibody test that helps detect the IgG antibody to SARS-CoV-2 using the company's Alinity i system.[62][63] Also in May, it received EUA from the FDA for a molecular COVID-19 test for use on the company's Alinity molecular laboratory instrument.[64][65]In August 2020, Abbott received EUA from the FDA for its credit-card-sized $5, 15-minute, portable COVID-19 antigen test, BinaxNOW, compatible with the NAVICA mobile app.[66][67]In October 2020, Abbott received EUA from the FDA for its lab-based COVID-19 IgM antibody blood test.[68] In December 2020, its rapid (20') antigen BinaxNOW COVID-19 test received EUA from the FDA for home use.[69][70]Forbes reported in January 2021 that the firm had delivered more than 400 million COVID-19 tests, 300 million in the fourth quarter of 2020.[71]In September 2021, Abbott acquired Walk Vascular, LLC.[72]In January 2022, Abbott introduced Lingo, a line of consumer biowearable sensors that collects a range of biological readings to optimize exercise and nutrition regimens.[73]Following the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, Abbott Laboratories continued its business operations in Russia while suspending non-essential activities such as new investments and advertising.[74][75] Research from Yale School of Management evaluating corporate responses to the invasion placed Abbott in the \"Buying Time\" category with a \"Grade D\" rating, indicating that it postponed future investments and marketing while continuing substantive business in Russia.[76]In May 2022, Abbott received 510(k) clearance from the FDA for FreeStyle Libre 3, the latest version of its continuous glucose monitor.[77]In August 2022, Abbott received FDA approval for Proclaim Plus, a multi-use spinal cord stimulation system designed to target chronic pain. The Proclaim Plus system is capable of treating six independent pain sites and has a recharge-free battery life of up to 10 years.[78]In October 2022, Abbott received EUA from the FDA for its real-time PCR test Alinity m MPXV; this marks the first FDA emergency authorization for commercial monkeypox testing.[79]On July 5, 2023, Abbott received approval from the FDA for its leadless pacemaker system Aveir DR.[80] In August, the company announced it would acquire Bigfoot Biomedical.[81]Today, Abbott operates in over 160 countries and sources from at least 62 suppliers worldwide.[82][83]Acquisition history[edit].mw-parser-output .hidden-begin{box-sizing:border-box;width:100%;padding:5px;border:none;font-size:95%}.mw-parser-output .hidden-title{font-weight:bold;line-height:1.6;text-align:left}.mw-parser-output .hidden-content{text-align:left}@media all and (max-width:500px){.mw-parser-output .hidden-begin{width:auto!important;clear:none!important;float:none!important}}Abbott Laboratories Acquisitions.mw-parser-output .treeview ul{padding:0;margin:0}.mw-parser-output .treeview li{padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none;list-style-image:none}.mw-parser-output .treeview li li{background:url(\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f2/Treeview-grey-line.png\")no-repeat 0 -2981px;padding-left:21px;text-indent:0.3em}.mw-parser-output .treeview li li:last-child{background-position:0 -5971px}.mw-parser-output .treeview li.emptyline>ul>.mw-empty-elt:first-child+.emptyline,.mw-parser-output .treeview li.emptyline>ul>li:first-child{background-position:0 9px}Abbott Laboratories(Est. 1885, Abbott Alkaloidal Company)Ross Laboratories (Acq 1964)SmithKline Beecham (Acq 1982, later sold)Knoll(Acq 2001)Selsun Blue(Sold to Chattem 2002)Murine (Sold to Prestige Brands 2002)Clear Eyes (Sold to Prestige Brands 2002)i-STAT (Acq 2004)TheraSense (Acq 2004)Guidant (vascular device division)(Acq 2006)IntraLase Corp (Acq 2007)Advanced Medical Optics(Acq 2009)Solvay Pharmaceuticals (Acq 2010)STARLIMS(Acq 2010)Lab Data Management Ltd (Acq 2008)IDEV Technologies (Acq 2013)OptiMedica Corporation (Acq 2013)Veropharm (Acq 2014)Topera, Inc (Acq 2014)Kalo Pharma Internacional S.L.

Ford took over as president and CEO,[92] and later chairman.[93]Recognition[edit]Abbott was ranked 86th  on the Fortune 500 list of largest US-based corporations in 2022.[94] Fortune also named Abbott as one of its Top 50 World's Most Admired Companies in 2021,[95] among its Blue Ribbon companies in 2021,[96] and to its Change the World list in 2020.[97] In 2022, Abbott was ranked #10 in Fast Company\u2019s Most Innovative Companies in Sports for Libre Sense and received an Honorable Mention for the World Changing Ideas Awards.[98][99] The Galien Foundation named Abbott\u2019s FreeStyle Libre as Best Medical Technology within the last 50 years (1970-2020).[100]The company has been listed on the Seramount/Working Mother's \"100 Best Companies\" list for 21 years in a row, named a top company for executive women by Seramount, and included on Science magazine's Top 20 Employers list.[101][102][103][104] The company has also been recognized as a top company by DiversityInc for diversity within the company for 19 consecutive years (2004-2022) and has been included on the Dow Jones Sustainability Index for 18 consecutive years.[105][106]Products[edit]Box of Abbott productsNutrition[edit]Pediatric nutrition products manufactured by Abbott Laboratories include:[107]SimilacSimilac GainSimilac GainPlusSimilac GainSchoolSimilac NeosureSimilac EssenciaSimilac Tummicare HWIsomilPedialytePediaSurePediaSure PlusPediaSure Plus 10+Adult nutrition products manufactured by Abbott Laboratories include:\nEnsureEnsure GoldGlucerna (Ensure Diabetes Care in India)JuvenZonePerfectDiagnostics[edit]Diagnostics products manufactured by Abbott include:[107]i-STAT (While intended for a human audience, the point of care analyzers also demonstrate utility for the veterinary profession[108] and are marketed by Abaxis.)AlinityArchitectIDNOWDigivalBinaxNOW[109]Medical devices[edit]Continuous glucose monitors:\nFreeStyle LibreFreeStyle Libre 2 SensorFreeStyle Libre 3 Sensor[110]Cardiovascular devices manufactured by Abbott Laboratories include:[107]MitraClipConfirm RxAmplatzer Piccolo OccluderHeartmateXienceCARDIOMEMSGallant ICDCentriMagAveir DR[a][80]Neuromodulation devices manufactured by Abbott Laboratories include:\nBurstDR TechnologyFlexBurst360 TechnologyProclaim DRG Neurostimulation SystemInfinity Deep Brain Stimulation SystemProclaim XR Recharge-Free Spinal Cord StimulatorNT2000IX Radiofrequency GeneratorProclaim Elite Recharge-Free SCS SystemProdigy MRI SCS SystemLitigation and controversies[edit]Leuprorelin[edit]In October 2001, the US Department of Justice, states attorneys general, and TAP Pharmaceutical Products, a subsidiary of Abbott Laboratories, settled criminal and civil charges against TAP related to federal and state Medicare fraud and illegal marketing of the drug leuprorelin.[111] TAP paid a total of $875 million,  a record high pharmaceutical settlement.[112][113] This comprised $290 million for violating the Prescription Drug Marketing Act, $559.5 million to settle federal fraud charges for overcharging Medicare, and $25.5 million reimbursement to 50 states and Washington, D.C., for filing false claims with the states' Medicaid programs.[113] The case arose under the False Claims Act with claims filed by Douglas Durand, a former TAP vice president of sales, and Joseph Gerstein, a doctor at Tufts University's HMO practice.[112] Durand, Gerstein, and Tufts shared $95 million of the settlement.[112]There have since been various suits concerning leuprorelin use, none successful.[114][115] These lawsuits have focused on either the over-prescription of the drug or the lack of warnings about its potential side effects. Between 2010 and 2013, the FDA updated the Lupron drug label to include new safety information on the risk of thromboembolism, loss of bone density and convulsions.[116] The FDA then said that the benefits of leuprorelin outweighed its risks when used according to its approved labeling. From 2017 the FDA  evaluated leuprorelin's connection to pain and discomfort in musculoskeletal and connective tissue.[117]Humira[edit]In March 2003, British company Cambridge Antibody Technology (CAT) stated its wish to \"initiate discussions regarding the applicability of the royalty offset provisions for Humira\" (Adalimumab) with Abbott Laboratories in the High Court of London. In December 2004, the judgment ruled for CAT.[118]Abbott was required to pay CAT US$255 million in lieu of royalties the MRC, the Scripps Research Institute and Stratagene would have received on sales of Humira after December 2004. Some of this sum was to be passed to its partners in development, including US$191 million for the UK Medical Research Council (MRC), plus a further $7.5 million over five years from 2006 providing that Humira remained on the market.[119]Operation Headwaters[edit]In October 2003, Abbott Laboratories and two of its units agreed to pay a total of $600 million in the first combined civil settlement and criminal conviction for offering kickbacks to agents of \"Operations Headwaters\", an undercover investigation by the FBI.[120]Depakote[edit]On 2 October 2012, the company was charged with a $500 million fine and $198.5 million forfeiture for illegal marketing of Depakote for uses not approved by the FDA. The court also sentenced Abbott to a five-year term of probation and court supervision.[121] Shareholders then brought derivative suits against the company directors for breach of fiduciary duty.[122][123] Following Abbott's spinoff of its research-based pharmaceuticals business, it no longer owns the commercial rights and associated responsibilities for Humira and Depakote.[124]Glucose monitors[edit]In 2021, two of Abbott Laboratories' subsidiaries, Arriva Medical LLC and Alere Inc, had to pay $160m to resolve claims that they had fraudulently billed Medicare for glucose monitors. The US Department of Justice said that Arriva used free glucose monitors to induce patients to order more consumable supplies, then took kickbacks on the increased sales. The company was also accused of charging Medicare for glucose monitors given to patients who were ineligible, or even dead.[125]Plant shutdown[edit]In February 2022, Abbott recalled baby formulas from the market and shut down their Michigan plant after complaints of illness and death in infants caused by serious bacterial infections. Following Abbotts' meeting the initial requirement of the U.S. Food & Drug Administration, the facility reopened in June 2022.[126][127][128][129]Deep Brain Stimulation Device Recall[edit]On July 18, 2023, Abbott recalled its Proclaim and Infinity IPGs due to complaints from patients who are unable to exit MRI mode. The use of the affected IPGs may require surgery to remove the device and replace it with a new device.\nThere have been 186 reported incidents and 73 reported injuries. There have been no reports of death.[130] Noted by Gita Amar, a PR representative for Abbott Laboratories on this issue. \"The company has communicated this action to physicians and regulatory bodies. No products need to be returned to the company or replaced.\"[131]Necrotizing Enterocolitis (NEC) Lawsuit[edit]On July 26, 2024, a jury ordered Abbott Laboratories to pay $495 million in the case of Margo Gill vs. Abbott Laboratories, comprising $95 million in compensatory damages and $400 million in punitive damages.[132] The lawsuit alleged that Abbott's infant formula for premature babies increased the risk of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), a gastrointestinal disease that can cause intestinal tissue death and can be life-threatening.\nSponsorship[edit]In 2015 Abbott became the title sponsor of the World Marathon Majors.[133]See also[edit]List of Illinois companiesList of largest biomedical companies by market capitalizationList of pharmaceutical companiesClara Abbott2022 United States infant formula shortageNotes and references[edit]Notes[edit].mw-parser-output .reflist{margin-bottom:0.5em;list-style-type:decimal}@media screen{.mw-parser-output .reflist{font-size:90%}}.mw-parser-output .reflist .references{font-size:100%;margin-bottom:0;list-style-type:inherit}.mw-parser-output .reflist-columns-2{column-width:30em}.mw-parser-output .reflist-columns-3{column-width:25em}.mw-parser-output .reflist-columns{margin-top:0.3em}.mw-parser-output .reflist-columns ol{margin-top:0}.mw-parser-output .reflist-columns li{page-break-inside:avoid;break-inside:avoid-column}.mw-parser-output .reflist-upper-alpha{list-style-type:upper-alpha}.mw-parser-output .reflist-upper-roman{list-style-type:upper-roman}.mw-parser-output .reflist-lower-alpha{list-style-type:lower-alpha}.mw-parser-output .reflist-lower-greek{list-style-type:lower-greek}.mw-parser-output .reflist-lower-roman{list-style-type:lower-roman}^pacemaker, received FDA approval on July 5, 2023References[edit]^.mw-parser-output cite.citation{font-style:inherit;word-wrap:break-word}.mw-parser-output .citation q{quotes:\"\\\"\"\"\\\"\"\"'\"\"'\"}.mw-parser-output .citation:target{background-color:rgba(0,127,255,0.133)}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-free.id-lock-free a{background:url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/65/Lock-green.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-limited.id-lock-limited a,.mw-parser-output .id-lock-registration.id-lock-registration a{background:url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d6/Lock-gray-alt-2.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-subscription.id-lock-subscription a{background:url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/aa/Lock-red-alt-2.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .cs1-ws-icon a{background:url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg\")right 0.1em center/12px no-repeat}body:not(.skin-timeless):not(.skin-minerva) .mw-parser-output .id-lock-free a,body:not(.skin-timeless):not(.skin-minerva) .mw-parser-output .id-lock-limited a,body:not(.skin-timeless):not(.skin-minerva) .mw-parser-output .id-lock-registration a,body:not(.skin-timeless):not(.skin-minerva) .mw-parser-output .id-lock-subscription a,body:not(.skin-timeless):not(.skin-minerva) .mw-parser-output .cs1-ws-icon a{background-size:contain;padding:0 1em 0 0}.mw-parser-output .cs1-code{color:inherit;background:inherit;border:none;padding:inherit}.mw-parser-output .cs1-hidden-error{display:none;color:var(--color-error,#d33)}.mw-parser-output .cs1-visible-error{color:var(--color-error,#d33)}.mw-parser-output .cs1-maint{display:none;color:#085;margin-left:0.3em}.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-left{padding-left:0.2em}.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-right{padding-right:0.2em}.mw-parser-output .citation .mw-selflink{font-weight:inherit}@media screen{.mw-parser-output .cs1-format{font-size:95%}html.skin-theme-clientpref-night .mw-parser-output .cs1-maint{color:#18911f}}@media screen and (prefers-color-scheme:dark){html.skin-theme-clientpref-os .mw-parser-output .cs1-maint{color:#18911f}}\"Locations and Contacts | Abbott U.S.\"^Japsen, Bruce. \"After 20 Years, Abbott Labs CEO Miles White Has Successor in Mind\".

The company does business as Merck Sharp & Dohme or MSD outside the United States and Canada. It is one of the largest pharmaceutical companies in the world, generally ranking in the global top five by revenue.[5][6]Merck & Co. was originally established as the American affiliate of Merck Group in 1891. Merck develops and produces medicines, vaccines, biologic therapies and animal health products. It has several blockbuster products, including cancer immunotherapy, anti-diabetic medications, and vaccines for HPV and chickenpox, each generating significant revenue as of 2020.[7]The company is ranked 71st on the 2022 Fortune 500[8] and 87th on the 2022 Forbes Global 2000,[9] both based on 2021 revenues. In 2023, the company\u2019s seat in the Forbes Global 2000 was 73.[10]Products[edit]Gardasil 9 in French packaging (showing the MSD branding)The company develops medicines, vaccines, biologic therapies and animal health products. In 2020, the company had 6 blockbuster drugs or products, each with over $1 billion in revenue: Keytruda (pembrolizumab), a humanized antibody used in cancer immunotherapy that had $14.3 billion in 2020 revenue; Januvia (sitagliptin), an anti-diabetic medication used to treat type 2 diabetes that had $5.3 billion in 2020 revenue; Gardasil, an HPV vaccine that had $3.9 billion in 2020 revenue; Varivax, a varicella vaccine used to protect against chickenpox that had $1.9 billion in 2020 revenues; Bridion (Sugammadex), a neuromuscular-blocking drug that had $1.2 billion in 2020 revenue; and Pneumovax 23, a pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine that had $1.1 billion in 2020 revenue. Other major products by the company include Isentress (raltegravir), an antiretroviral medication used to treat HIV/AIDS that had $857 million in 2020 revenue; Simponi (golimumab), a humanmonoclonal antibody used as an immunosuppressive drug that had $838 million in 2020 revenue; RotaTeq, a rotavirus vaccine that had $797 million in 2020 revenue; and Lynparza (olaparib), a medication for the maintenance treatment of BRCA-mutated advanced ovarian cancer in adults that generated $725 million in 2020 revenue for the company.[1]Details of Merck's major products are as follows:\nJanuvia (sitagliptin) is a dipeptidyl peptidase IV inhibitor for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. In 2013, Januvia was the second largest selling diabetes drug worldwide.[11] Januvia is commonly paired with the generic anti-diabetes drug metformin. It has been popular due in part because unlike many other diabetes drugs, it causes little or no weight gain and is not associated with hypoglycemic episodes.[12][13] Merck also sells a single pill combination drug containing both Januvia and metformin under the trade name Janumet. There has been some concern that treatment with Januvia and other DPP-IV inhibitors may be associated with a modestly increased risk of pancreatitis.[14]Zetia (ezetimibe) is a drug for hypercholesterolemia that acts by inhibiting the absorption of dietary cholesterol. Zetia has been controversial, as it was initially approved based on its impact on serum cholesterol levels without proof that it actually impacted the incidence of cardiovascular disease. Results of the IMPROVE-IT study, however, introduced at the 2014 Scientific Sessions of the American Heart Association, showed a statistically significant, albeit modest, benefit in adding Zetia to simvastatin for high-risk, post-acute-coronary-syndrome patients.[15]Remicade (infliximab) is a monoclonal antibody directed toward the cytokine TNF-alpha and used for the treatment of a wide range of autoimmune disorders, including rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease, ankylosing spondylitis, plaque psoriasis, and others. Remicade and other TNF-alpha inhibitors exhibit additive therapeutic effects with methotrexate and improve quality of life. Adverse effects include increased risk of infection and certain cancers.[16] Merck had rights to the drug in certain areas, while Janssen Biotech had rights in other areas;[17] in 2017, Merck announced a biosimilar to Remicade, Renflexis.[18]Gardasil (recombinant human papilloma virus vaccine) is a vaccine against multiple serotypes of human papilloma virus (HPV), which is responsible for most cases of cervical cancer worldwide.[19]Isentress (raltegravir) is a human immunodeficiency virus integrase inhibitor for the treatment of HIV infection. It is the first anti-HIV compound having this mechanism of action.[20] It is part of one of several first line treatment regimens recommended by the United States Department of Health and Human Services.[21]Keytruda (pembrolizumab) is an immune modulator for the treatment of cancer. On September 4, 2014, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Pembrolizumab (MK-3475) as a breakthrough therapy for melanoma treatment.[22] In clinical trials, pembrolizumab provided partial tumor regression in about one quarter of patients, many of whom have not seen further progression of their disease in over 6 months of follow-up.[23]Invanz (Ertapenem) is an injectable antibiotic, rights to which Merck has owned since 1999.[24] Merck was in a legal dispute with the Taiwanese company Savior Lifetec over their attempt to secure rights to sell a generic drug version in the United States.[24] Savior has since obtained approval to market generic ertapenem.[25]Mexsana is an antiseptic medicated powder.Mectizan (ivermectin) is an anti-parasitic medicine traditionally used to treat river blindness. It is the focus of Merck's Mectizan Donation Program, wherein Merck has donated doses of the drug to treat millions of people in countries such as Yemen and African nations.Molnupiravir is an antiviral pill to treat COVID-19,[26] developed in partnership with Ridgeback Biotherapeutics.Merck & Co. publishes The Merck Manuals, a series of medical reference books for physicians, nurses, technicians, and veterinarians. These include the Merck Manual of Diagnosis and Therapy, the world's best-selling medical reference. The Merck Index, a compendium of chemical compounds, was published by Merck & Co. until it was acquired by the Royal Society of Chemistry in 2012.\nHistory[edit]Roots and early history[edit]Main article: Merck GroupThe Angel Pharmacy in Darmstadt, the beginning of the Merck GroupMerck & Co. traces its origins to its former German parent company Merck Group, which was established by the Merck family in 1668 when Friedrich Jacob Merck purchased a pharmacy in Darmstadt.[27][28] In 1827, Merck Group evolved from a pharmacy to a drug manufacturer company with the commercial manufacture of morphine.[29] Merck perfected the chemical process of deriving morphine from opium and later introduced cocaine, used to treat sinus problems and to add to beverages to boost energy levels.[30]In 1887 a German-born, long-time Merck employee, Theodore Weicker, went to the United States to represent Merck Group.[31] In 1891, with $200,000 received from E. Merck, Weicker started Merck & Co., with headquarters in lower Manhattan. That year George Merck, the 23-year-old son of the then head of E. Merck (and grandson of the founder) joined Weicker in New York.[32][27][28] Merck & Co. operated from 1891 to 1917 as the US subsidiary of the Merck Group.[28]Nationalization[edit]After the U.S. entered World War I, due to its German connections, Merck & Co. was the subject of expropriation under the Trading with the Enemy Act of 1917.[33] The government seized 80 percent of the shares owned by the German parent company and sold it.[34] In 1919, George F. Merck (head of the American branch of the Merck family), in partnership with Goldman Sachs and Lehman Brothers, bought the company back at a U.S. government auction for $3.5 million, but Merck & Co. remained a separate company from its former German parent.[35][36] Merck & Co. holds the trademark rights to the \"Merck\" name in the United States and Canada, while its former parent company retains the rights in the rest of the world; the right to use the Merck name was the subject of litigation between the two companies in 2016.[37][38][39][40]In 1925, George W. Merck succeeded his father George F. Merck as president. In 1927, the corporation merged with the Powers-Weightman-Rosengarten Company, a Philadelphia quinine manufacturer. George Merck remained president and Frederic Rosengarten became chairman of the board.[41][42] In 1929, H. K. Mulford Company merged with Sharp and Dohme, Inc. and brought vaccine technology, including immunization of cavalry horses in World War I and delivery of a diphtheria antitoxin to Merck & Co.\nIn 1943, streptomycin was discovered during a Merck-funded research program in Selman Waksman's laboratory at Rutgers University. It became the first effective treatment for tuberculosis. At the time of its discovery, sanatoriums for the isolation of tuberculosis-infected people were a ubiquitous feature of cities in developed countries, with 50% dying within 5 years of admission.[43][44] Although Merck's agreement with Rutgers gave it exclusive rights to streptomycin, at Waksman's request the company renegotiated the agreement, returning the rights to the university in exchange for a royalty. The university then set up non-exclusive licenses with seven companies to ensure a reliable supply of the antibiotic.[45]1950\u20132000[edit]In the 1950s, thiazide diuretics were developed by Merck scientists Karl H. Beyer, James M. Sprague, John E. Baer, and Frederick C. Novello[46] and led to the marketing of the first drug of this class, chlorothiazide, under the trade name Diuril in 1958.[47] The research leading to the discovery of chlorothiazide, leading to \"the saving of untold thousands of lives and the alleviation of the suffering of millions of victims of hypertension\" was recognized by a special Public Health Award from the Lasker Foundation in 1975.[48]In 1953, Merck & Co. merged with Philadelphia-based Sharp & Dohme, Inc., becoming the largest U.S. drugmaker. Sharp and Dohme had acquired H. K. Mulford Company in 1929, adding smallpox vaccines to its portfolio.[49][50][51][52][53][27] The combined company kept the trade name Merck in the United States and Canada, and as Merck Sharp & Dohme (MSD) outside North America.[40]In 1965, Merck & Co. acquired Charles Frosst Ltd. of Montreal (founded 1899), creating Merck-Frosst Canada, Inc., as its Canadian subsidiary and pharmaceutical research facility. Merck & Co. closed this facility in July 2010 but remerged in 2011 as Merck Canada.[54][55]Maurice Hilleman, a scientist at Merck, developed the first mumps vaccine in 1967,[56] the first rubella vaccine in 1969,[57] and the first trivalent measles, mumps, rubella (MMR vaccine) in 1971.[58] The incidence of rubella-associated birth defects fell from up to 10,000 per year in the U.S. to zero in the aftermath of the rubella vaccine's development.[59] Hilleman also developed the first Hepatitis B vaccine and the first varicella vaccine, for chickenpox.[60]The company was incorporated in New Jersey in 1970. John J. Horan became CEO and Chairman in 1976, serving until 1985.[61] Under his leadership, the company's investment in R&D grew threefold, and Merck became the largest pharmaceutical company in the world.[61][62]In 1979, Merck scientists developed lovastatin (Mevacor), the first drug of the statin class.[63]Merck scientist William C. Campbell and Satoshi \u014cmura developed ivermectin for veterinary use in 1981, and later put it to human use against Onchocerciasis in 1987\u201388 with the name Mectizan;[64] today the compound is used against river blindness, lymphatic filariasis, scabies and other parasitic infections.[65][66][67]In 1982, the company formed a joint venture, KBI Inc., with AstraZeneca.[68] During the late 1980s and 1990s, the company also established joint ventures with DuPont to access research and development expertise, and with Johnson & Johnson to sell over-the-counter consumer medications.[citation needed]In 1985, Merck received approval for imipenem, the first member of the carbapenem class of antibiotics. Antibiotics of the carbapenem class play an important role in treatment guidelines for certain hospital-acquired and multi-drug resistant infections.[69]P. Roy Vagelos became CEO and Chairman that year, succeeding Horan.[70]In 1991, Merck's Kelco subsidiary was responsible for volatile organic compound (VOC) emission pollution in the San Diego area. In 1996 Merck paid $1.8 million for polluting the air. New machines were installed to reduce smog emissions by 680,000\u00a0lb (310,000\u00a0kg) a year.[71]In November 1993, Merck & Co. acquired Medco Containment Services for $6 billion.[72][73] Merck & Co. spun Medco off ten years later.[74]Merck's supply chain reduction programme has been referred to as an example of successful change. Merck reduced its number of global suppliers from 40,000 to less than 10,000 during the period from 1992 to 1997.[75]2001\u20132019[edit]Merck Research Laboratories in South San Francisco, CaliforniaIn May 2002, The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation purchased stock in Merck.[76]From 2002 through 2005, the Australian affiliate of Merck paid publishing house Elsevier an undisclosed amount to produce eight issues of a medical journal, the Australasian Journal of Bone and Joint Medicine. Although it gave the appearance of being an independent peer-reviewed journal, without any indication that Merck had paid for it, the journal actually reprinted articles that originally appeared in other publications and that were favorable to Merck. The misleading publication came to light in 2009 during a personal injury lawsuit filed over Vioxx; 9 of 29 articles in the journal's second issue referred positively to Vioxx.[77][78] The CEO of Elsevier's Health Sciences Division, Michael Hansen, admitted that the practice was \"unacceptable\".[79]In 2005, CEORaymond Gilmartin retired following Merck's voluntary worldwide withdrawal of Vioxx. Former president of manufacturing Richard Clark was named CEO and company president.[80]In November 2009, Merck & Co. completed a merger with Schering-Plough in a US$41 billion deal.[81][82] Although Merck & Co. was in reality acquiring Schering-Plough, the purchase was declared a \"reverse merger\", in which \"Old\" Merck & Co. was renamed Merck Sharp & Dohme, and Schering-Plough renamed as \"Merck & Co., Inc.[83] The maneuver was an attempt avoid a \"change-of-control\" in order to preserve Schering-Plough's rights to market Remicade. A settlement with Johnson & Johnson was reached in 2011, in which Merck agreed to pay $500 million.[17][84] Merck Sharp & Dohme remains a subsidiary of the Merck & Co. parent.[1]Richard Clark retired as CEO and company president in October 2011 and Kenneth Frazier became CEO.[85]In October 2013, Merck announced it would cut 8,500 jobs in an attempt to cut $2.5 billion from its costs by 2015. Combined with 7,500 job cuts announced in 2011 and 2012, the layoffs amounted to 20% of its workforce.[86][87]By 2014, research performed at Merck has led to U.S. FDA approval of 63 new molecular entities.[88]In August 2014, Merck acquired Idenix Pharmaceuticals for $3.85 billion.[89][90]In December 2014, the company acquired Swiss biotechnology company OncoEthix for up to $375 million.[91][92]Between 2010 and 2015, the company cut around 36,450 jobs.[93] During that time, the company sold its consumer health business to Bayer and narrowed the company's focus to immunology, vaccines, diabetes, emerging markets and medicines used in hospitals, like certain antibiotics.[93]In January 2015, Merck acquired Cubist Pharmaceuticals for $102 per share in cash or about $9.5 billion in total.[94]In July 2015, Merck and Ablynx expanded their 18-month-old immuno-oncology collaboration by four years, generating a potential $4.4 billion in milestone payments for the Abylnx.[95] The company also announced it would spend $95 million up front collaborating with cCAM Biotherapeutics and its early-stage treatment similar to Keytruda. Merck & Co. will bring in CM-24, an antibody designed to block the immune checkpoint CEACAM1.[96]In January 2016, Merck announced two new partnerships; the first with Quartet Medicine and its small molecule pain treatments,[97] the second with Complix investigating intracellular cancer targets,[98] with both collaborations potentially generating up to $595 million and $280 million respectively. Days later the company announced it would acquire IOmet Pharma, with IOmet becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of Merck & Co. The acquisition includes IOmets indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO), tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase (TDO), and dual-acting inhibitors.[99]In July 2016, the company acquired Afferent Pharmaceuticals, developer of a candidate used to block P2RX3 receptors, for approximately $1 billion, plus up to $750 million in milestone payments.[100][101]In 2017, Merck bought the PARP inhibitor Lynparza from AstraZeneca.[102]In April 2017, Merck Animal Health acquired Vall\u00e9e S.A., a Brazilian animal health product manufacturer.[103]In September 2017, the company announced it would acquire Rigontec, developer of a candidate to target the retinoic acid-inducible gene I pathway, for $554 million.[104][105]In October 2017, the company granted the inaugural Merck-AGITG Clinical Research Fellowship in Gastro-Intestinal (GI) Cancer to David Lau, a professional in Melbourne, Australia.[106][107]In June 2018, Merck acquired Viralytics, an Australian viral cancer drug company, for AUD$502 million.[108]In 2018, Merck began the submission process for a Biologics License Application to the Food and Drug Administration under the Breakthrough Therapy Designation for an investigational vaccine, called V920, to fight the Zaire strain of the Ebola virus.[109]In April 2019, the company acquired Immune Design for approximately $300 million, gaining access to its immunotherapy programs.[110][111] It also acquired Antelliq Group for $2.4 billion, or $3.7 billion including debt.[112]In May 2019, Merck announced it would acquire Peloton Therapeutics, developer of a HIF-2alpha inhibitor for Von Hippel\u2013Lindau disease-associated renal cell carcinoma, for up to $2.2 billion.[113]In June 2019, Merck announced it would acquire Tilos Therapeutics for up to $773 million.[114]In November 2019, the company acquired Calporta, which focused on Parkinsons and Alzheimers treatments.[115]In December 2019, Merck Animal Health acquired Vaki, an aquaculture company, from Pentair.[116]2020\u2013present[edit]In January 2020, Merck acquired ArQule, developer of ARQ 531, an oral Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor, for $2.7 billion.[117]In March 2020, Merck was one of ten companies recognised at the inaugural Manufacturing Awards by New Jersey Business magazine and the New Jersey Business and Industry Association.[118]In June 2020, Merck acquired Themis Bioscience, a company focused on vaccines and immune-modulation therapies for infectious diseases including COVID-19 and cancer.[119][120][121]Also in June 2020, Merck Animal Health acquired Quantified Ag, a data and analytics company that monitors cattle body temperature and movement in order to detect illness early.[122]In August 2020, Merck Animal Health acquired IdentiGEN, engaged in DNA-based animal traceability.[123]In September 2020, Merck acquired $1 billion of Seattle Genetics common stock, and agreed to co-develop ladiratuzumab vedotin.[124][125]In November 2020, Merck announced it would acquire VelosBio for $2.75 billion, developer of VLS-101, an antibody-drug conjugate designed to target Tyrosine kinase-like orphan receptor 1 (ROR1) in both hematological and solid tumors. VLS-101 is currently Phase I and Phase II clinical trials.[126] The company also announced it would acquire OncoImmune for $425 million and its phase 3 candidate, CD24Fc, used in the treatment of patients with severe and critical COVID-19.[127][128]In February 2021, Merck Animal Health acquired PrognostiX Poultry.[129]In March 2021, Merck Head of Corporate Affairs Petra Wicklandt represented the company at the Munich Security Conference, where she participated in a tabletop exercise simulating the public health response to the release of a weaponized strain of monkeypox.[130]In April 2021, Merck acquired Pandion Therapeutics for $1.85 billion, expanding its offering in treating autoimmune diseases.[131][132][133]In June 2021, the U.S. government agreed to spend $1.2 billion to purchase 1.7 million doses of Molnupiravir, a Merck product, if it were to be approved by regulators to treat COVID-19.[134] In October 2021, the company said that the drug reduces the risk of hospitalization or death by around 50% for patients with mild or moderate cases of COVID-19 and that it would seek Emergency Use Authorization for the drug.[135]In July 2021, Robert M. Davis became CEO, succeeding Kenneth Frazier, who became executive chairman.[136][137][138][139]In July 2021, Merck completed the corporate spin-off of Organon & Co.[140]In September 2021, Merck announced it would acquire Acceleron Pharma for $11.5 billion, gaining control over Sotatercept, used in the treatment of pulmonary hypertension, and luspatercept-aamt.[141]In September 2022, the company announced it would acquire Vence, a livestock management company for an undisclosed sum, incorporating it within Merck Animal Health.[142]In December 2022, the company announced a licensing deal with Kelun-Biotech of China whereby it would expand its early cancer pipeline with a set of antibody-drug conjugates; this follows an earlier agreement between the two companies to co-develop such drugs.[143]In April 2023, Merck announced it would acquire Prometheus Biosciences Inc for $10.8 billion.[144]In December 2023, Merck announced it had partnered with Owkin to develop artificial intelligence-powered digital pathology diagnostics that could be used to identify patients suitable for immunotherapies.

The main positions are HPN328, an activator of T-cells that is being researched to treat advanced cancer patients associated with DLL3 expression (delta-like ligand 3), an inherent small cell lung cancer (SCLC), neuroendocrine tumors, and several other species. Merck\u2019s portfolio will also be complemented by T-cell attractions using the patented Harpoon Tri-specific design for T cell activation (TriTAC). According to engineering protein technology, tumor cells are destroyed by the patient\u2019s own immune cells, and the ProTriTAC platform works with the TriTAC platform to develop a therapeutic agent that attracts T-cells,  but is inactive until it reaches the tumor.[147]In April 2024, Merck completed the acquisition of Abceutics for $208m.[148]In July 2024, Merck completed the acquisition of EyeBio for $3bn.[149]In October 2024, Merck announced the acquisition of Modifi Biosciences for $1.3bn.[150]Acquisition history[edit].mw-parser-output .hidden-begin{box-sizing:border-box;width:100%;padding:5px;border:none;font-size:95%}.mw-parser-output .hidden-title{font-weight:bold;line-height:1.6;text-align:left}.mw-parser-output .hidden-content{text-align:left}@media all and (max-width:500px){.mw-parser-output .hidden-begin{width:auto!important;clear:none!important;float:none!important}}Merck & Co Acquisitions.mw-parser-output .treeview ul{padding:0;margin:0}.mw-parser-output .treeview li{padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none;list-style-image:none}.mw-parser-output .treeview li li{background:url(\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f2/Treeview-grey-line.png\")no-repeat 0 -2981px;padding-left:21px;text-indent:0.3em}.mw-parser-output .treeview li li:last-child{background-position:0 -5971px}.mw-parser-output .treeview li.emptyline>ul>.mw-empty-elt:first-child+.emptyline,.mw-parser-output .treeview li.emptyline>ul>li:first-child{background-position:0 9px}Merck & Co(Founded in 1891 as the US subsidiary of Merck of Darmstadt, later Nationalised by the US government in 1917 during the first World War)Merck & Co\nMerck & Co\nH.

Current projects include the development of low cost, thermostable vaccines for the prevention of cholera, rotavirus, and meningitis.[160]Merck for Mothers[edit]Merck for Mothers is Merck's global initiative to help create a world where no woman has to die while giving life.[161][non-primary source needed]Mectizan donation program[edit]In 1987, Merck began a program with UNICEF to donate its new drug Mectizan to \"all that need it for as long as needed\"[162] in an effort to combat onchocerciasis, also known as river blindness, primarily in Africa. Up to that point, the World Health Organization had fought the disease through the use of insecticides to lower the population of its primary vector, the Black Fly.[163] However, when studies in the 1980s showed how effective the drug was at treating and preventing the disease, the WHO agreed to use it instead of its previous strategies.[64] Merck's involvement is considered a key factor in the success against the disease all over the world,[164] and the decision to donate the entirety of the drug to all those in need of it is used as part of the Mectizan Donation Program that covers countries such as Yemen and African countries.[165] More than 700 million people have been treated since the inception of the program with 80 million people still undergoing treatment in Africa, Latin America, and Yemen. Blindness caused by onchocerciasis is decreasing, and there are regions of Latin America and Africa that have been shown to have eliminated the disease altogether.[165]Lawsuits and controversies[edit]Vioxx[edit]In 1999, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Vioxx (known generically as rofecoxib), a Merck product for treating arthritis. Vioxx was designed as a selective inhibitor of the enzyme cyclooxygenase-2. Such compounds were expected to cause less gastrointestinal bleeding than older anti-inflammatory drugs such as naproxen, which were associated with 20,000 hospitalizations and 2000 deaths each year.[166][non-primary source needed] Vioxx became one of the most prescribed drugs in history.[167]Thereafter, studies by Merck and by others found an increased risk of heart attack associated with Vioxx use when compared with naproxen. Merck adjusted the labeling of Vioxx to reflect possible cardiovascular risks in 2002.[168]On September 23, 2004, Merck received information about results from a clinical trial it was conducting that included findings of increased risk of heart attacks among Vioxx users who had been using the medication for over eighteen months.[169] On September 28, 2004, Merck notified the FDA that it was voluntarily withdrawing Vioxx from the market, and it publicly announced the withdrawal on September 30. An analysis for the period 1999\u20132004, based on U.S. Medical Expenditure Survey data, reported that Vioxx was associated with 46,783 heart attacks, and along with the other popular COX-2 inhibitorCelebrex, an estimated 26,603 deaths from both.[170][171]About 50,000 people sued Merck, claiming they or their family members had suffered medical problems such as heart attacks or strokes after taking Vioxx.[172] In November 2007, Merck agreed to pay $4.85 billion to settle most of the pending Vioxx lawsuits.[173] The settlement required that claimants provide medical and pharmacy records confirming the occurrence of a heart attack, ischemic stroke, or sudden cardiac death; the receipt of at least 30 Vioxx pills within 60 days prior to the injury or death; and confirmation of Vioxx being used within 14 days of the Vioxx-related event.[174] The settlement was generally viewed by industry analysts and investors as a victory for Merck, considering that original estimates of Merck's liability reached between $10 billion and $25 billion.[173] As of mid-2008, when the plaintiff class had reached the threshold percentage required by Merck to go through with the settlement, plaintiffs had prevailed in only three of the twenty cases that had reached juries, all with relatively small awards.[172]Merck has refused to consider compensation for Vioxx victims and their families outside the US. This is particularly true in the UK where there are at least 400 victims and the legal protection afforded to the victims and their families is particularly weak.[175]According to internal e-mail traffic released at a later lawsuit, Merck had a list of doctors critical of Vioxx to be \"neutralized\" or \"discredited\". \"We may need to seek them out and destroy them where they live,\" wrote an employee. A Stanford Medical School professor said that Merck was engaged in intimidation of researchers and infringement upon academic freedom.[176]On May 20, 2008, Merck settled for $58 million with 30 states alleging that Merck engaged in deceptive marketing tactics to promote Vioxx.[177] All its new television pain-advertisements must be vetted by the Food and Drug Administration and changed or delayed upon request until 2018.[178]Fosamax[edit]Fosamax (alendronate) is a bisphosphonate used for the treatment of post-menopausal osteoporosis and for the prevention of skeletal problems in certain cancers. The American College of Clinical Endocrinology, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the North American Menopause Society and the UK National Osteoporosis Guideline Group recommend alendronate and certain other bisphosphonates as first line treatments for post-menopausal osteopotosis.[179][180][181] Long-term treatment with bisphosponates produces anti-fracture and bone mineral density effects that persist for 3\u20135 years after an initial 3\u20135 years of treatment.[182] Alendronate reduces the risk of hip, vertebral, and wrist fractures by 35-39%.[183][184]In December 2013, Merck agreed to pay a total of $27.7 million to 1,200 plaintiffs in a class action lawsuit alleging that the company's osteoporosis drug had caused them to develop osteonecrosis of the jaw. Prior to the settlement, Merck had prevailed in 3 of 5 so-called bellwether trials. Approximately 4000 cases still await adjudication or settlement as of August 2014.[185]There have also been thousands of lawsuits alleging that Fosamax increased the risk of thigh-bone fractures.[186] In March 2022, Merck defeated approximately 500 lawsuits over Fosamax in New Jersey when U.S. District JudgeFreda L. Wolfson ruled that the plaintiffs' lawsuit was preempted by federal law.[187] On September 20, 2024, the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit overturned that decision, holding that federal law did not block plaintiffs' state law claims against Merck over Fosamax.[186] As of June 30, 2024, about 3,115 lawsuits over Fosamax were still pending against Merck in both federal and state courts in the United States.[186]Medicaid overbilling[edit]A fraud investigation by the United States Department of Justice began in 2000 when allegations were brought in two separate lawsuits filed by whistleblowers under the False Claims Act.[188] They alleged that Merck failed to pay proper rebates to Medicaid and other health care programs and paid illegal remuneration to health care providers.[189] On February 7, 2008, Merck agreed to pay more than $650 million to settle charges that it routinely overbilled Medicaid for its most popular medicines. The settlement was one of the largest pharmaceutical settlements in history. The federal government received more than $360 million, plus 49 states and Washington, DC, received over $290 million. One whistleblower received a $68 million reward. Merck made the settlement without an admission of liability or wrongdoing.[188][190][191]\"Merck\" name legal dispute[edit]In 191 of 193 countries, the original Merck company, the Merck Group of Darmstadt, owns the rights to the \"Merck\" name. In the United States and Canada, the company trades under the name EMD (an abbreviation of Emanuel Merck, Darmstadt), its legal name here says Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany, and instead of \"Merck Group\", the \"EMD Group\" name is used. In the United States and Canada, Merck & Co. holds the rights to the trademark \"Merck\", while in the rest of the world the company trades under the name MSD (an abbreviation of Merck, Sharp & Dohme) and its legal name says here Merck Sharp & Dohme LLC., a subsidiary of Merck & Co., Inc. Kenilworth, NJ, USA.\nIn 2015 the Merck Group adopted a new logo and said it will be \"much more aggressive\" about protecting the brand of \"the real Merck\".[192] Merck of Darmstadt has initiated litigation against its former subsidiary, Merck & Co. (MSD) of Kenilworth, in several countries over infringing use of the Merck name. In 2016, the High Court of Justice in the United Kingdom ruled that MSD had breached an agreement with its former parent company and that only Merck of Darmstadt is entitled to use the Merck name in the United Kingdom.[40] The judge also held that MSD's use of \"Merck\" as part of branding on its global websites were directed to the UK and infringed Merck's trade mark rights in the UK.[193]In response to the ruling, MSD initiated counter-litigation in the United States in January 2016 by filing a federal lawsuit which accused its former parent company of \"infringing on its trademark\" through actions that included the increased usage of \"Merck KGaA\" and \"MERCK\" in branding in the US as well as on its social media presence. Further Merck & Co. has also accused the Merck Group of federal trademark dilution, unfair competition, false advertising, deceptive trade practices, breach of contract, and cybersquatting. The case came to a head when a research scientist believed he was communicating with Merck & Co regarding a research grant in oncology, when in fact he was talking with the Merck Group. As a result, Merck & Co. asked the federal court to stop the Merck Group from using \"Merck\" on any products or marketing materials in the United States. As a direct result, Merck & Co is seeking \"all monetary gains, profits, and advantages\" made by the Merck Group and three-times the damage, plus additional punitive damages.[37]In April 2020, in the course of litigation of Merck against MSD in Switzerland, the Federal Supreme Court of Switzerland ruled that MSD's use of the \"Merck\" brand in its global websites could, absent geotargeting mechanisms, have \"commercial effect\" in Switzerland and could therefore violate Merck's rights (if any) to the \"Merck\" brand in Switzerland.[194]Tax fraud[edit]In 2007, Merck paid $2.3 billion to settle allegations of offshore tax fraud between 1993 and 2001.[195]Propecia[edit]In 2021, an investigation by Reuters revealed that Merck's baldness drug Propecia caused persistent sexual dysfunction in men.[196] The drug has been linked to over 700 incidences of suicidal thoughts[197] and 110 deaths.[196] Merck has been receiving reports since 1998, but never included the risks on the label.[196] In 2015, Merck was sued by consumer-rights law firm Hagens Berman over a wrongful death linked to Propecia.[198]Environmental violations[edit]Merck & Co. once used methylene chloride, an animal carcinogen on the United States Environmental Protection Agency's list of pollutants, as a solvent in some of its manufacturing processes. Merck chemists and engineers subsequently replaced the compound with others having fewer negative environmental effects. Merck has also modified its equipment to protect the environment, installing a distributed control system that coordinates chemical reactions more efficiently and expedites manufacturing by 50 percent, eliminating the need for the disposal and storage of harmful waste. Biological oxygen demand has also been reduced. In 2011, Merck paid a $1.5 million civil penalty to settle alleged violations of federal environmental laws at its pharmaceutical manufacturing facilities in Riverside, Pennsylvania and West Point, Pennsylvania.[199]Public-private engagement[edit]Conferences[edit]Merck was a Conference Supporter for the Virtual ISPOR Asia Pacific conference in September 2020.[200]Political lobbying[edit]Merck is a contributing member of AcademyHealth, a health researchadvocacy network that also includes government agencies, universities, pharmaceutical companies and lobbying groups.[201]References[edit].mw-parser-output .reflist{margin-bottom:0.5em;list-style-type:decimal}@media screen{.mw-parser-output .reflist{font-size:90%}}.mw-parser-output .reflist .references{font-size:100%;margin-bottom:0;list-style-type:inherit}.mw-parser-output .reflist-columns-2{column-width:30em}.mw-parser-output .reflist-columns-3{column-width:25em}.mw-parser-output .reflist-columns{margin-top:0.3em}.mw-parser-output .reflist-columns ol{margin-top:0}.mw-parser-output .reflist-columns li{page-break-inside:avoid;break-inside:avoid-column}.mw-parser-output .reflist-upper-alpha{list-style-type:upper-alpha}.mw-parser-output .reflist-upper-roman{list-style-type:upper-roman}.mw-parser-output .reflist-lower-alpha{list-style-type:lower-alpha}.mw-parser-output .reflist-lower-greek{list-style-type:lower-greek}.mw-parser-output .reflist-lower-roman{list-style-type:lower-roman}^ abc.mw-parser-output cite.citation{font-style:inherit;word-wrap:break-word}.mw-parser-output .citation q{quotes:\"\\\"\"\"\\\"\"\"'\"\"'\"}.mw-parser-output .citation:target{background-color:rgba(0,127,255,0.133)}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-free.id-lock-free a{background:url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/65/Lock-green.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-limited.id-lock-limited a,.mw-parser-output .id-lock-registration.id-lock-registration a{background:url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d6/Lock-gray-alt-2.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-subscription.id-lock-subscription a{background:url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/aa/Lock-red-alt-2.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .cs1-ws-icon a{background:url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg\")right 0.1em center/12px no-repeat}body:not(.skin-timeless):not(.skin-minerva) .mw-parser-output .id-lock-free a,body:not(.skin-timeless):not(.skin-minerva) .mw-parser-output .id-lock-limited a,body:not(.skin-timeless):not(.skin-minerva) .mw-parser-output .id-lock-registration a,body:not(.skin-timeless):not(.skin-minerva) .mw-parser-output .id-lock-subscription a,body:not(.skin-timeless):not(.skin-minerva) .mw-parser-output .cs1-ws-icon a{background-size:contain;padding:0 1em 0 0}.mw-parser-output .cs1-code{color:inherit;background:inherit;border:none;padding:inherit}.mw-parser-output .cs1-hidden-error{display:none;color:var(--color-error,#d33)}.mw-parser-output .cs1-visible-error{color:var(--color-error,#d33)}.mw-parser-output .cs1-maint{display:none;color:#085;margin-left:0.3em}.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-left{padding-left:0.2em}.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-right{padding-right:0.2em}.mw-parser-output .citation .mw-selflink{font-weight:inherit}@media screen{.mw-parser-output .cs1-format{font-size:95%}html.skin-theme-clientpref-night .mw-parser-output .cs1-maint{color:#18911f}}@media screen and (prefers-color-scheme:dark){html.skin-theme-clientpref-os .mw-parser-output .cs1-maint{color:#18911f}}\"Merck & Co., Inc. 2024 Form 10-K Annual Report\".

The company is part of the Nasdaq-100, S&P 100 and S&P 500. As of 31\u00a0December\u00a02021[update], Intuitive Surgical had an installed base of 6,730 da Vinci Surgical Systems, including 4,139 in the U.S., 1,199 in Europe, 1,050 in Asia, and 342 in the rest of the world.[2]Intuitive Surgical made its debut on the Fortune 500 list in 2024, ranking #497.[3]History[edit]The research that eventually led to the development of the da Vinci Surgical System was performed in the late 1980s by Ajit Shah and Gary Guthart at research institute SRI International.[4][5]  In 1990, SRI received funding from the National Institutes of Health.  SRI developed a prototype robotic surgical system that caught the interest of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), which was interested in the system for its potential to allow surgeons to operate remotely on soldiers wounded on the battlefield.\nIn 1994, Dr. Frederic Moll became interested in the SRI System, as the device was known at the time. At the time, Moll was employed by Guidant. He tried to interest Guidant in backing it but to no avail. In 1995 Moll was introduced to John Freund who had recently left Acuson Corporation. Freund negotiated an option to acquire SRI's intellectual property and incorporated a new company that he named Intuitive Surgical Devices, Inc.\nAt that point Freund, Moll, and Robert Younge (also from Acuson) wrote the business plan for the company and raised its initial venture capital.  Early investors included the Mayfield Fund, Sierra Ventures, and Morgan Stanley.[citation needed]The company refined the SRI System into a prototype known originally as \"Lenny\" (after Leonardo da Vinci), which was ready for testing in 1997. As the company's prototypes became more advanced, they were named using da Vinci themes. One was named \"Leonardo\", and another was \"Mona\". The final version of the prototype was nicknamed the da Vinci Surgical System, and the name stuck when the system was eventually commercialized. After further testing, Intuitive Surgical began marketing this system in Europe in 1999, while awaiting FDA approval in the United States.[citation needed][6]The company raised $46 million in an initial public offering in 2000.  That same year, the FDA approved use of the da Vinci Surgical System for general laparoscopic surgery, which can be used to address gallbladder disease and gastroesophageal disease.  In 2001, the FDA approved use of the system for prostate surgery.  The FDA has subsequently approved the system for thoracoscopic surgery, cardiac procedures performed with adjunctive incisions, and gynecologic procedures.[7]Shortly before going public, Intuitive Surgical was sued for patent infringement by Computer Motion, Inc, its chief rival.  Computer Motion had actually gotten into the robotic surgery field earlier than Intuitive Surgical, with its own system, the ZEUS Robotic Surgical System.  Although the ZEUS system was approved in Europe, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration had not yet approved it for any procedure at the time that the FDA first approved the da Vinci system.  The uncertainty created by the litigation between the companies was a drag on each company's growth. In 2003, Intuitive Surgical and Computer Motion agreed to merge, thus ending the litigation between them.[8]  The ZEUS system was ultimately phased out in favor of the da Vinci system. Computer Motion was led by Chairman Robert Duggan from 1990 until 2003, when the two companies merged.[9]Before the buyout of Computer Motion, the stock of Intuitive was selling at around $14 per share, adjusted for stock splits. After the merger, the stock price rose significantly (and by 2015 it was at about $500),[10] primarily because of the growth in systems sold (60 in 2002 compared with 431 in 2014) and the number of surgical procedures performed (less than 1,000 in 2002 compared with 540,000 in 2014).[citation needed]Finances[edit]For the fiscal year 2017, Intuitive Surgical reported earnings of US$660 million, with an annual revenue of US$3.129 billion, an increase of 15.7% over the previous fiscal cycle. Intuitive Surgical's shares traded at over $307 per share, and its market capitalization was valued at over US$58 billion in November 2018.[11]Year\nRevenuein mil. US$\nNet incomein mil.

The system is controlled by a surgeon from a console. \nThis minimally invasive surgical approach is commonly used for prostatectomies and increasingly for cardiac valve repair and gynaecologic surgical procedures.[14][15] \nA da Vinci Surgical System costs approximately $1.5 million.[16] The da Vinci SI released in April 2009 cost about $1.75 million. In addition, there are maintenance contracts plus expenditures for instruments used during surgery. In 2008, The New York Times reported that most hospitals and clinics have a hard time recovering the cost of the robot.[15]Lawsuits[edit]In June 2018, Intuitive Surgical settled class action suits of its shareholders for a payment of $43 million.[17][18] Originally filed in 2013, shareholders alleged Intuitive Surgical failed to report injuries related to their da Vinci robot, thus violating federal security laws. [19]In 2021, Intuitive was sued for alleged abuse of its monopolist position. Specifically, replacement part manufacturer Rebotix Repair accused Intuitive of anticompetitive behavior in the robots' aftermarket business and overcharging of hospitals for replacement parts.[citation needed] The initiative was followed up by a wave of similar class-action lawsuits shortly afterwards, including those filed by Kaleida Health and Franciscan Health.[20][21] In August of 2022, Rebotix v. Intuitive settled out of court shortly before trial was set to begin.[22][23]Sultzer v. Intuitive Surgical, Inc. involved a claim against Intuitive that a defect in its da Vinci surgical robot allowed electricity to arc through a patient's spine, resulting in her death.[24] Intuitive was represented by Bradley Arant Boult Cummings.[24] On July 12, 2024, the plaintiff agreed to drop the case.[24]References[edit].mw-parser-output .reflist{margin-bottom:0.5em;list-style-type:decimal}@media screen{.mw-parser-output .reflist{font-size:90%}}.mw-parser-output .reflist .references{font-size:100%;margin-bottom:0;list-style-type:inherit}.mw-parser-output .reflist-columns-2{column-width:30em}.mw-parser-output .reflist-columns-3{column-width:25em}.mw-parser-output .reflist-columns{margin-top:0.3em}.mw-parser-output .reflist-columns ol{margin-top:0}.mw-parser-output .reflist-columns li{page-break-inside:avoid;break-inside:avoid-column}.mw-parser-output .reflist-upper-alpha{list-style-type:upper-alpha}.mw-parser-output .reflist-upper-roman{list-style-type:upper-roman}.mw-parser-output .reflist-lower-alpha{list-style-type:lower-alpha}.mw-parser-output .reflist-lower-greek{list-style-type:lower-greek}.mw-parser-output .reflist-lower-roman{list-style-type:lower-roman}^.mw-parser-output cite.citation{font-style:inherit;word-wrap:break-word}.mw-parser-output .citation q{quotes:\"\\\"\"\"\\\"\"\"'\"\"'\"}.mw-parser-output .citation:target{background-color:rgba(0,127,255,0.133)}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-free.id-lock-free a{background:url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/65/Lock-green.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-limited.id-lock-limited a,.mw-parser-output .id-lock-registration.id-lock-registration a{background:url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d6/Lock-gray-alt-2.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-subscription.id-lock-subscription a{background:url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/aa/Lock-red-alt-2.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .cs1-ws-icon a{background:url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg\")right 0.1em center/12px no-repeat}body:not(.skin-timeless):not(.skin-minerva) .mw-parser-output .id-lock-free a,body:not(.skin-timeless):not(.skin-minerva) .mw-parser-output .id-lock-limited a,body:not(.skin-timeless):not(.skin-minerva) .mw-parser-output .id-lock-registration a,body:not(.skin-timeless):not(.skin-minerva) .mw-parser-output .id-lock-subscription a,body:not(.skin-timeless):not(.skin-minerva) .mw-parser-output .cs1-ws-icon a{background-size:contain;padding:0 1em 0 0}.mw-parser-output .cs1-code{color:inherit;background:inherit;border:none;padding:inherit}.mw-parser-output .cs1-hidden-error{display:none;color:var(--color-error,#d33)}.mw-parser-output .cs1-visible-error{color:var(--color-error,#d33)}.mw-parser-output .cs1-maint{display:none;color:#085;margin-left:0.3em}.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-left{padding-left:0.2em}.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-right{padding-right:0.2em}.mw-parser-output .citation .mw-selflink{font-weight:inherit}@media screen{.mw-parser-output .cs1-format{font-size:95%}html.skin-theme-clientpref-night .mw-parser-output .cs1-maint{color:#18911f}}@media screen and (prefers-color-scheme:dark){html.skin-theme-clientpref-os .mw-parser-output .cs1-maint{color:#18911f}}\"Intuitive Surgical, Inc. 2024 Annual Report Form (10-K)\".

He became president and CEO in 2009.[79]Partnerships[edit]In September 2017, Thermo Fisher Scientific signed an agreement with the Institute of Pathology Heidelberg (IPH) to establish its Center of Molecular Pathology at Heidelberg University Hospital as the newest member of the Next Generation Sequencing Companion Dx Center of Excellence Program (COEP). The initiative focuses on establishing strategic collaborations with leading, European-based organizations that can lead studies using Thermo Fisher's Oncomine portfolio of research panels destined for development as companion diagnostics to help drive precision oncology in the region.[80]In 2021, Thermo Fisher announced the construction of a cell therapy development, manufacturing and collaboration center in cooperation with University of California, San Francisco on the school's Mission Bay campus.[81]In February 2022, Thermo Fisher Scientific announced a 15-year strategic collaboration\nagreement with Moderna, Inc. The collaboration was designed to scale up the\nmanufacturing of Moderna\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine and other investigational mRNA\nproducts.[82]In May 2023, Thermo Fisher partnered with Pfizer, with plans to work together on expanding testing capabilities for lung and breast cancer patients.[83]In November 2023, Thermo Fisher partnered with Flagship Pioneering, a biotechnology company.[84] Together, they plan to create companies in the biotechnology field.[85]Controversies[edit]Xinjiang and Tibet[edit].mw-parser-output .hatnote{font-style:italic}.mw-parser-output div.hatnote{padding-left:1.6em;margin-bottom:0.5em}.mw-parser-output .hatnote i{font-style:normal}.mw-parser-output .hatnote+link+.hatnote{margin-top:-0.5em}@media print{body.ns-0 .mw-parser-output .hatnote{display:none!important}}Further information: Persecution of Uyghurs in China and Human rights in TibetIn February 2019, Thermo Fisher Scientific announced that it would stop selling its equipment in Xinjiang.[86] In June 2020, Thermo Fisher Scientific was reported to sell its equipment to security services in China for use in what was alleged as part of a genetic surveillance program.[87] A report from the Australian Strategic Policy Institute found that Thermo Fisher Scientific collaborated with the Chinese Ministry of Public Security to develop a Huaxia PCR amplification kit specifically to identify the genotypes of Uyghur, Tibetan and Hui ethnic minorities.[88] In June 2021, The New York Times reported that, despite bans, Thermo Fisher Scientific equipment continued to be sold to police in Xinjiang.[89]In 2022, following reports that Thermo Fisher Scientific had sold products to police in the Tibet Autonomous Region,[90] the Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China called on governments to \"investigate and suspend commercial activities with companies providing the PRC government with technologies to carry out biometric surveillance in the Uyghur Region, Tibet and elsewhere in the PRC, including the PRC state backed BGI Group and US firm Thermo Fisher.\"[91] Thermo Fisher Scientific subsequently halted sales of DNA collection kits in Tibet.[92]HeLa cells[edit]In October 2021 the estate of Henrietta Lacks sued to get past and future payment for the alleged and widely known unauthorized sale by Thermo Fisher Scientific of her HeLa cells which are essential in many types of research.[93] Over 50 million tons of her cells have been produced and used in over 60,000 scientific studies touching virtually every realm of medicine, including the development of polio vaccines, gene mapping, in-vitro fertilization, and multitudes more.[94][95][96]In May 2022, it was announced Thermo Fisher Scientific went to court to seek a dismissal of the lawsuit.[97] In late July 2023, with the motion to dismiss still outstanding, the court ordered the parties to attend a settlement conference.[98][99] Soon after that, settlement of the suit, with undisclosed terms, was announced.[100]Mexican plant[edit]In 2013, Opengate Capital Group LLC filed suit against Thermo Fisher Scientific for selling it a manufacturing plant controlled by the Gulf Cartel. According to Opengate Capital, the company withheld important documents and pressured employees into concealing the presence of the drug cartel.[101][102]References[edit].mw-parser-output .reflist{margin-bottom:0.5em;list-style-type:decimal}@media screen{.mw-parser-output .reflist{font-size:90%}}.mw-parser-output .reflist .references{font-size:100%;margin-bottom:0;list-style-type:inherit}.mw-parser-output .reflist-columns-2{column-width:30em}.mw-parser-output .reflist-columns-3{column-width:25em}.mw-parser-output .reflist-columns{margin-top:0.3em}.mw-parser-output .reflist-columns ol{margin-top:0}.mw-parser-output .reflist-columns li{page-break-inside:avoid;break-inside:avoid-column}.mw-parser-output .reflist-upper-alpha{list-style-type:upper-alpha}.mw-parser-output .reflist-upper-roman{list-style-type:upper-roman}.mw-parser-output .reflist-lower-alpha{list-style-type:lower-alpha}.mw-parser-output .reflist-lower-greek{list-style-type:lower-greek}.mw-parser-output .reflist-lower-roman{list-style-type:lower-roman}^.mw-parser-output cite.citation{font-style:inherit;word-wrap:break-word}.mw-parser-output .citation q{quotes:\"\\\"\"\"\\\"\"\"'\"\"'\"}.mw-parser-output .citation:target{background-color:rgba(0,127,255,0.133)}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-free.id-lock-free a{background:url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/65/Lock-green.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-limited.id-lock-limited a,.mw-parser-output .id-lock-registration.id-lock-registration a{background:url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d6/Lock-gray-alt-2.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-subscription.id-lock-subscription a{background:url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/aa/Lock-red-alt-2.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .cs1-ws-icon a{background:url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg\")right 0.1em center/12px no-repeat}body:not(.skin-timeless):not(.skin-minerva) .mw-parser-output .id-lock-free a,body:not(.skin-timeless):not(.skin-minerva) .mw-parser-output .id-lock-limited a,body:not(.skin-timeless):not(.skin-minerva) .mw-parser-output .id-lock-registration a,body:not(.skin-timeless):not(.skin-minerva) .mw-parser-output .id-lock-subscription a,body:not(.skin-timeless):not(.skin-minerva) .mw-parser-output .cs1-ws-icon a{background-size:contain;padding:0 1em 0 0}.mw-parser-output .cs1-code{color:inherit;background:inherit;border:none;padding:inherit}.mw-parser-output .cs1-hidden-error{display:none;color:var(--color-error,#d33)}.mw-parser-output .cs1-visible-error{color:var(--color-error,#d33)}.mw-parser-output .cs1-maint{display:none;color:#085;margin-left:0.3em}.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-left{padding-left:0.2em}.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-right{padding-right:0.2em}.mw-parser-output .citation .mw-selflink{font-weight:inherit}@media screen{.mw-parser-output .cs1-format{font-size:95%}html.skin-theme-clientpref-night .mw-parser-output .cs1-maint{color:#18911f}}@media screen and (prefers-color-scheme:dark){html.skin-theme-clientpref-os .mw-parser-output .cs1-maint{color:#18911f}}\"Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. 2024 Annual Report (Form 10-K)\".

(formerly Applied Molecular Genetics Inc.) is an American multinational biopharmaceuticalcompany headquartered in Thousand Oaks, California.[3][4] As one of the world's largest independent biotechnology companies, Amgen has approximately 24,000 staff in total as of 2022.[5]The name \"AMGen\" is a portmanteau of the company's original name, Applied Molecular Genetics, which became the official name of the company in 1983 (three years after incorporation and coincident with its initial public offering). The company is listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the ticker symbol \"AMGN\", as well as a component of the Nasdaq-100, the Dow Jones Industrial Average, and the S&P 100 and 500 indices.\nHistory[edit]AMGen corporate logo, 1983Argentine president Mauricio Macri meets with heads of Amgen, in 2018.Amgen was established in Thousand Oaks in 1980, as Applied Molecular Genetics.[6][7] Amgen was backed by a small group of venture capitalists, and its early focus was on recombinant DNA technology and recombinant human insulin.[8]Its initial scientific advisory board consisted of Norman Davidson, Leroy Hood, Arnold Berk, John Carbon, Robert Schimke, Arno Motulsky, Marvin H. Caruthers, and Dave Gibson.[9] In October 1980, Amgen named George Rathmann its first president and chief executive officer.[8]On June 17, 1983, Amgen went public, selling two million common shares and raising nearly $40 million.[10][11][12] That same year, after more than two years of work, an Amgen research team led by Fu-Kuen Lin had a breakthrough in finding and cloning the erythropoietin gene, a protein created in the kidney that stimulates red blood cell production. Lin's team created what would become Epogen (epoetin alfa).[13][14]In 1985, Amgen researcher Larry Souza and his team cloned granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), leading to the development of Neupogen (filgrastim).[14][15][16]In October 1988, Gordon Binder was named CEO, succeeding George Rathmann.[17] The following year, in 1989, Amgen received approval for the first recombinant human erythropoetin product, Epogen (epoetin alfa).[18][19]In February 1991, Amgen received FDA approval for Neupogen for the prevention of infections in patients whose immune systems are suppressed due to cancer chemotherapy.[20][21]Amgen opened a new manufacturing facility in Puerto Rico, in March 1993, which later became the company's flagship manufacturing site.[22][23]In 1994, Amgen became the fifth company to receive the U.S. Department of Commerce's National Medal of Technology and Innovation, in recognition of its work developing medicines to improve quality of life for kidney and cancer patients.[24] Also around this time, Amgen researcher Steve Elliott and his team added more sugar molecules to erythropoietin, causing it to remain in the body longer. This led to the development of Aranesp (darbepoetin alfa).[25]2000-2014[edit]Binder was succeeded as CEO by Kevin W. Sharer in 2000.[26] Robert A. Bradway became Amgen's president and chief executive officer in May 2012, following Sharer's retirement.[27]In March 2011, Amgen acquired a manufacturing facility near Dublin, Ireland, in March.[28]Amgen also opened an affiliate in China in 2013.[29][30]In November 2014 the company announced it was halting all trials of rilotumumab in advanced gastric cancer patients after one of the trials found more deaths in those who took the compound with chemotherapy, than those without.[31] Later in the same week, the company in conjunction with AstraZeneca reported positive results for brodalumab in a Phase III trial comparing the compound with ustekinumab and a placebo in treating psoriasis.[32] In the same month, construction was completed on Amgen's next-generation biomanufacturing facility in Singapore.[33] Blincyto (blinatumomab) was approved by the FDA in December of that year.[34][35]Amgen's Thousand Oaks staff in 2022 numbered approximately 5,000[36] (8.5% of total city employment)[37] and included hundreds of scientists, making Amgen the largest employer in Ventura County.[7][38]Timeline[edit]This article is in list format but may read better as prose.

The trial evaluated the efficacy of Otezla and two other medicines in severely ill, hospitalized COVID-19 patients who required high-flow oxygen.[158]In October 2020, Amgen announced positive topline Phase 2 results from the CodeBreaK 100 clinical study, evaluating sotorasib in 126 patients with KRAS G12C-mutant advanced NSCLC who had failed three or fewer prior lines of anti-cancer therapies (including immunotherapy and/or chemotherapy).[159] Amgen, the Global Coalition for Adaptive Research, and Eisai Co., Ltd. also announced enrollment of the first patient in a study testing multiple interventions for the treatment of patients hospitalized with COVID-19.[160][161]In November 2020, Amgen, Takeda, and UCB, as part of the COVID R&D alliance, announced the first patient enrolled in another trial evaluating Otezla and two other drugs as treatments for COVID-19.[162] Amgen also announced that it would terminate its collaboration with Cytokinetics and transition the development and commercialization rights for omecamtiv mecarbil and AMG 594.[163] Amgen and AstraZeneca announced positive topline results from a Phase 3 trial in which the investigational medicine tezepelumab demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in exacerbations in patients with severe asthma.[164]In December 2020, the FDA granted breakthrough therapy designation to sotorasib for advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer patients with KRAS G12C mutation.[165]In May 2021, sotorasib received accelerated approval from FDA for treatment of adult patients with NSCLC whose tumors have a KRAS G12C mutation and who have received at least one prior systemic therapy; this was the first approved targeted therapy for tumors with any KRAS mutation.[166] Similar approvals for sotorasib in NSCLC followed in January 2022 in Europe[167] and Japan.[168]In September 2022, data from a late-stage study showed the company's cancer pill Lumakras beating out chemotherapy. This was the first approved drug in the set of treatments that target KRAS, among the most common generic mutations found in cancers but one where researchers have struggled for years to design drugs to treat. The drug was approved in 2021 with a list price of $17,900 per month.[169]In March 2025, data for the drug Tezspire, showed the best results for treating chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps.[170] In the same month, Amgen announced the start of two late-stage trials for MariTide, a weight loss drug.[171][172]Carbon footprint[edit]Amgen reported Total CO2e emissions (Direct + Indirect) for the twelve months ending 31 December 2020 at 243 Kt (-6 /-2.4% y-o-y)[173] and aims to reach net zero emissions by 2027.[174]Amgen's annual Total CO2e Emissions - Location-Based Scope 1 + Scope 2 (in kilotonnes)[173]Dec 2014Dec 2015Dec 2016Dec 2017Dec 2018Dec 2019Dec 2020\n354369292279264249243\nControversies[edit]The Los Angeles Times reported on December 18, 2012, that Amgen pleaded guilty and agreed to pay $150 million in criminal penalty and $612 million to resolve 11 related whistleblower complaints. Federal prosecutors accused the company of pursuing profits while putting patients at risk.[175]  Larry Husten, a contributor at Forbes.com elaborates on AMGEN's illegal marketing practices in this case, namely that the \"government accused Amgen of marketing Aranesp for indications not approved by the FDA and other illegal marketing practices\".[176]Public-private engagement[edit]Amgen engages with the public and private sectors in a variety of settings including to promote research and development, academic funding, event sponsorship, philanthropy, and political lobbying.\nAcademia[edit]Institute for Advanced Study - Donor to various IAS campaigns, including the IAS/Park City Mathematics Institute (PCMI), the Regional Initiative in Science and Education (RISE), and the Opportunity Equation (OE).[177]LA Promise Fund - Sponsor of the Amgen Biotech Experience Los Angeles (ABE-LA).[178]University of Toronto - Donor to U of T's Boundless campaign.[179]University of Washington - Donor.[180]Events and conferences[edit]Alberta Kidney Days - Virtual series sponsor.[181]BC Kidney Days - Sponsor.[182]Mentoring in IBD - Sponsor.[183]Princess Margaret Cancer Centre (PMCC) Conference - Sponsor.[184]Health care[edit]Kingston General Hospital - Donor.[185]Princess Margaret Cancer Centre - Donor to the Princess Margaret Cancer Foundation.[186]Providence Health Care - Donor.[187]Scarborough Health Network - Donor to the SHN Foundation.[188]SickKids - Donor to the SickKids Foundation.[189]Sinai Health System - Donor to the Sinai Health Foundation.[190]St. Michael's Hospital - Donor.[191]Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre - Donor to the Sunnybrook Foundation.[192]Unity Health Toronto - Donor.[191]University Health Network - Donor to the UHN Foundation.[193]Women's College Hospital - Donor.[194]Media[edit]National Geographic Society - Donor.[195]Medical societies[edit]American Society of Hematology - Corporate funder.[196]Arthritis Society (Canada) - Partner.[197]Canadian Society of Hospital Pharmacists - Donor to the CSHP Foundation.[198]Canadian Society of Nephrology - Corporate partner.[199]Endocrine Society - Corporate liaison board member.[200]European Society of Cardiology - Sponsor for the EORP registry programme.[201]Federation of Medical Women in Canada - Sponsor.[202]Political lobbying[edit]Alliance for a Stronger FDA - Member.[203]Alliance for Aging Research - Donor.[204]BIOTECanada - Member.[205]Bipartisan Policy Center - Donor.[206]The Business Council - Member, represented by Amgen chairman and CEO Robert A.

Boston Scientific is widely known for the development of the Taxus Stent, a drug-eluting stent which is used to open cloggedarteries.[3] With the full acquisition of Cameron Health in June 2012, the company also became notable for offering a minimally invasive implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) which they call the EMBLEM subcutaneous implantable defibrillator (S-ICD).[4][5]History[edit]Boston Scientific was formed June 29, 1979, in Watertown, Massachusetts, as a holding company for the medical products company, Medi-Tech, Inc., and to position the company for growth in interventional medicine.[6] Medi-Tech was the brainchild of Itzhak Bentov, a Czech-born \u00e9migr\u00e9 to Israel and then to the United States, who worked at the Arthur D. Little think tank in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and ran a contract research company from his rented house in Belmont, Massachusetts, a venture he founded in 1965 with a business friend, Dan Singer. In 1967 he was asked by Boston Beth Israel Hospital radiologists to design a steerable, remotely controlled catheter; a series of engineering designs, polymer improvements and prototypes led to the release of a new steerable angiography catheter in 1969. That year John Abele joined the small company with an option to buy, and a year later he exercised his option with Cooper Labs as a business partner, and the operation was moved \u2013 out of Bentov's lab in the basement of the rectory of a Catholic church[7] in Belmont \u2013 to Watertown. After a decade of steady growth, by chance Abele met Pete Nicholas in their neighborhood in Concord, Massachusetts. Their partnership hinged on Nicholas' goal to build business enterprises and Abele's predilection for the vision and potential in noninvasive surgical instrumentation; they gathered backers in the Boston banking community to buy out the Cooper Labs interest and form the new corporation.[citation needed]Less than a year later Kimray Medical Associates (later Mansfield Scientific, Inc.) was acquired, adding vena cava filters and cardiac output computers to the product line. By 1982 a renovated mill building in Watertown was transformed into a manufacturing plant. Acquisitions continued, with Endo-Tech (Microvasive, Inc.: gastrointestinal and pulmonary) in 1981 and then Van-Tec (urology) in 1988, and an international presence was expanded. Mansfield Scientific, Microvasive, and Medi-Tech merged into Boston Scientific December 31, 1988.[8]Initial public offering (1992)[edit]On May 19, 1992, Boston Scientific launched an initial public offering of 23.5 million shares, of which 18.8 million were offered in the U.S. and 4.7 million were offered outside the U.S. The initial offering amounted to 23% of Boston Scientific's outstanding stock. The opening price was $17 per share.[6]Goldman, Sachs & Co. (lead) and PaineWebber Inc. were the underwriters and Abbott Laboratories held a 20% stake (23.5 million shares). The market capitalization was about $1.6 billion.[9][a] The U.S. shares were listed on the New York Stock Exchange.\nPost\u2013IPO[edit]TAXUS\u2122 Express2\u2122 Paclitaxel-Eluting Coronary StentFrom 1995 through 1997, Boston Scientific increased its technology R&D and product offerings following several substantial acquisitions that included Cardiovascular Imaging Systems (intravascular ultrasound), SCIMED (cardiovascular), Vesica Medical (urology), Meadox (textile vascular prostheses), EP Technologies (cardiac ablation controllers),[12] MinTec (abdominal aortic aneurysm grafts), Symbiosis Corporation (specialty medical product manufacture), and Target Therapeutics (on neurology).[13] Boston Scientific acquired Target Therapeutics in a tax-free stock swap for about $1.1 billion, more than 10 times Target's total sales, in contrast to the usual multiple of 10 times earnings.[14]The Taxus Stent was approved in 2003 in Europe and other countries and, in the United States, by the FDA in March 2004. It was the second drug-eluting stent approved in the United States.[3]In April 2004 the company announced that it had exercised an exclusive option to acquire Precision Vascular Systems, Inc., as part of a series of agreements between Boston Scientific and Precision Vascular in 2002 \u2013 for an undisclosed sum.[15] In June Boston acquired Advanced Bionics Corporation for $740 million in cash, plus earn out payments.[16] In December Boston completed its acquisition of Advanced Stent Technologies, Inc., for $120 million payable in Boston Scientific stock, plus the possibility of future contingent payments. AST had been developing stent and stent delivery systems specifically designed to address the anatomical needs of coronary artery disease in bifurcated vessels.[17]In April 2005, Boston exercised an exclusive option to acquire TriVascular, Inc., for an undisclosed sum and renamed it as Boston Scientific Santa Rosa Corporation, or BSSR. TriVascular was founded in January 1998 to develop less-invasive medical devices and procedures for treating abdominal aortic aneurysms, but BSC discontinued its endovascular aortic repair (EVAR) program in 2006.[18][19] Also, in April 2005, BSC announced it had exercised its option to acquire CryoVascular Systems, Inc., and its proprietary angioplasty device to treat atherosclerotic disease of the legs and other peripheral arteries.[20] In June Boston Scientific announced that its wholly owned subsidiary, Nemo I Acquisition, Inc., had successfully acquired Salt Lake City-based Rubicon Medical Corporation, with Rubicon became a wholly owned subsidiary of Boston Scientific.[21]In March 2008, BSC sold BSSR to TV2 Holding Company of Santa Rosa. Terms of the sale include $30 million in cash paid at the closing to BSC and a warrant allowing BSC to purchase a minority interest in TV2.[22][19]Guidant merger[edit]In January 2006, the company announced an offer for its longtime competitor, Guidant, for $72 per share or $25 billion.[23] The offer, however, was rejected. On April 21, 2006, BSC acquired Guidant for $27.2 billion. Guidant was split between BSC and Abbott Laboratories.[24][25] Four years later, in 2010, when moving its heart-rhythm business from its acquisition of Guidant, Boston Scientific eliminated 1300 jobs.[26]Post-merger[edit]In December 2007, Boston Scientific announced it would sell its Fluid Management and Venous Access businesses for $425 million to Avista Capital Partners.[27]In April 2008, the company acquired CryoCor, Inc., for $1.35 per share, $17.6 million in total.[28][29]Navilyst Medical was formed in February 2008 from Boston Scientific's Fluid Management and Vascular Access business units.[30]In January 2009, Boston announced it would acquire Labcoat Limited, whose primary development was that of a development-stage drug-eluting stent \u2013 for an undisclosed sum.[31]In October 2010, the company was fined $600,000 by the US Department of Justice for paying a US Army doctor to use their devices and recommend them to others.[32] In the same month Boston Scientific acquired Asthmatx, Inc., for $193.5 million, with payments of up to $250 million being paid on the achievement of specified revenue-based criteria through 2019.[33]In January 2011, Boston acquired Atritech, Inc., for $100 million plus additional potential payments of up to $275 million.[34] Atritech developed a novel device called the Watchman\u00ae designed to close the left atrial appendage in patients with atrial fibrillation who are at risk for ischemic stroke.[35] In the same month, Boston Scientific acquired Intelect Medical, Inc., for $78 million[36] and the remaining 86% of Sadra Medical, Inc., not already owned for $193 million plus contingent payments.[37] At the same time, the business divested its neurovascular business to Stryker Corporation for $1.5 billion.[38]In June 2012, Boston Scientific officially acquired Cameron Health for a total sum of $1.3 billion, paid out incrementally as various revenue milestones were achieved.[4] In September the company announced it would acquire BridgePoint Medical, Inc., developer of a catheter-based system to treat coronary chronic total occlusions.[39] In October, the company acquired Rhythmia Medical, Inc., developer of mapping and navigation methods for use in cardiac catheter ablations and other electrophysiology procedures.[40]  A month later the business acquired catheter-based renal denervation system developer, Vessix Vascular, Inc.[41]In November 2013, Boston announced it would acquire Bard EP, the electrophysiology business of C.R. Bard, Inc.,[42] for $275 million.[43]In May 2014, Boston acquired hysteroscopic intrauterine tissue removal specialist, IoGyn, Inc.[44] In September, the business announced it would acquire the Interventional business of Bayer.[45]In March 2015, the company announced it would acquire Endo International Plc's American Medical Systems urology business for at least $1.6 billion, expanding the company's health and prostate treatments.[46] In April, Boston announced its intention to acquire Xlumena, Inc.[47] In October Boston announced it had invested further in percutaneous mitral valve replacement system developer, MValve Technologies, gaining a right to acquire the business in the future.[48]As of 2016, it operates in more than 100 countries, employs more than 24,000 people, and manufactures around 13,000 diverse products.[49] In July 2016 the business acquired the manufacturer of radiofrequency ablation systems, Cosman Medical, Inc.[50] In September, Boston announced it had acquired EndoChoice Holdings, Inc., becoming part of the Boston Scientific Endoscopy business for $8.00 per share or $210 million in total.[51][52] In November the company acquired the gynecology and urology portfolio of Distal Access, LLC, a company that designs minimally invasive medical devices.[53] In December 2016, the business acquired a 15% stake in Neovasc, Inc., for $75 million.[54]In May 2017, the company acquired Symetis SA, a developer of minimally invasive transcatheter aortic valve implantation devices.[55] In October Boston acquired Apama Medical Inc. for up to $300 million.[56]In April 2018, Boston Scientific announced the triple closure of its acquisitions of women's health company, nVision Medical Corporation,[57] NxThera[58] and Securus Medical Group, Inc., for up to $50 million.[59] In July, Boston Scientific announced it would acquire Cryterion Medical, Inc,[60] Veniti, Inc.,[61] in August Augmenix, Inc., and Claret Medical, Inc.[62] and in October[63] In late November Boston announce they would acquire UK medical device maker, BTG plc, for $4.2 billion.[64] BTG, before being acquired, was publicly traded and a constituent of the FTSE 250 Index. In late December, the company announced it would acquire Millipede, Inc for $325 million \u2013 after previously investing $90 million in the company.[65].mw-parser-output .portalbox{padding:0;margin:0.5em 0;display:table;box-sizing:border-box;max-width:175px;list-style:none}.mw-parser-output .portalborder{border:1px solid var(--border-color-base,#a2a9b1);padding:0.1em;background:var(--background-color-neutral-subtle,#f8f9fa)}.mw-parser-output .portalbox-entry{display:table-row;font-size:85%;line-height:110%;height:1.9em;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold}.mw-parser-output .portalbox-image{display:table-cell;padding:0.2em;vertical-align:middle;text-align:center}.mw-parser-output .portalbox-link{display:table-cell;padding:0.2em 0.2em 0.2em 0.3em;vertical-align:middle}@media(min-width:720px){.mw-parser-output .portalleft{margin:0.5em 1em 0.5em 0}.mw-parser-output .portalright{clear:right;float:right;margin:0.5em 0 0.5em 1em}}Companies portalIn May 2019, the company announced it would acquire Vertiflex, Inc., with the aim of increasing its interventional pain therapy offerings.

(Acq pending)Organizational culture[edit]BSC has been assessed favorably by its employees. In Glassdoor annual Best Places to Work \u2013 Employee's Choice Survey, BSC earned scores of:\n2018: #35 (of 100). 4.4 stars (of 5).[79]2019: #56 (of 100). 4.3 stars (of 5).[80]2022: #52 (of 100). 4.3 stars (of 5).[81]The feedback for this survey is given by current and former employees. As of 2018, BSC had 43% women among its employees, 38% among management positions, and 23% among corporate top management positions (data for US workforce, as of 2018).[82]Social commitment[edit]Boston Scientific has set a standard for implementing an integrative organizational culture and states that it actively strives to further improve this by, among other things, increasing diversity among its employees \u2013 and in particular, among its managers, executives, and directors. To this end, the company has set itself the following goals in 2018:[83][84]Leadership role by belonging to the top 10 companies in the integration of employees of the following groups: women, people of color, disabled persons and members of the LGBTQ community.Increase the proportion of people of color with supervisor or managerial functions to 20% in the USA including Puerto Rico (end of 2018: 19.6%, +1.8% compared to 2017).Increase the proportion of women in supervisor or managerial positions to 40% worldwide (end of 2018: 38.4%, +1.0% against 2017).Success for these objectives has been chronicled and ranked by publications and organizations, including:\nForbes added the company in 2019 to its list of Best Employers For Diversity for its efforts to foster a corporate culture that welcomes and supports all employees. That year, BSC ranked 85th out of 500 companies.[85]Forbes included BSC in its 2021 and 2022 lists as well \u2013 ranking it 6th in 2021 and 171st in 2022, out of 500 for both years.[86][87]Bloomberg recognized BSC for its inclusion in the Gender-Equality Index in 2019, which includes companies that publicly demonstrate their commitment to equality and the advancement of women in the workplace. The index lists a total of 230 companies from ten economic sectors and 36 countries and regions.[88]The US magazine Working Mother, in 2017, listed BSC, for the first time, along with 9 other companies, as one of the \"100 Best Companies for Working Mothers.\"[89] The publication, again, listed BSC in 2018, 2019, and 2020.[90]The Human Rights Campaign (\"HRC\") named BSC as a Best Place to Work for LGBTQ Equality in its 2019 edition of the eponymous list. HRC has given BSC a ranking of 100 (of 100) every year from 2015 through 2022 in its annual CEI Index (Corporate Equality Index) rankings of Fortune 1000 companies.[91]The journal, US Black Engineer & Information Technology (USBE & IT), in its \"2021 Top Supporters of HBCU Engineering,\" ranked BSC No. 6 among the \"Top 20 Industry Supporters.\"[92]Litigation[edit]Johnson & Johnson patent litigation[edit]Beginning in 2003, Boston Scientific and Johnson & Johnson were involved in a series of litigations involving patents covering heart stent medical devices. Both parties claimed that the other had infringed upon their patents. The litigation was settled once Boston Scientific agreed to pay $716\u00a0million to Johnson & Johnson in September 2009 and an additional $1.73\u00a0billion in February 2010.[93]It was announced in November 2014 that Johnson & Johnson would have another chance for payback after a multibillion-dollar trial was set for November 20, 2014. A New York federal court judge would hear the case without a jury to decide whether Boston Scientific should be held liable for the contract breach.[94]Transvaginal mesh[edit]Boston Scientific is one of several manufacturers of a medical device called transvaginal mesh, a type of surgical mesh used to treat pelvic organ prolapse. Experts concluded that the medical company had used cheap, counterfeit resin, which was both toxic and degraded when exposed to oxygen.[95][96] When this was announced on 60 Minutes, Boston Scientific responded by saying the broadcast was \"irresponsible and misleading,\"[97] citing a 2017 Food and Drug Administration (FDA) report stating that although they found variability in the polypropylene resin, \"these differences do not present new safety or effectiveness concerns.\"[98] One woman, who sued in 2011, was awarded $100 million. Two operations had failed to remove all the parts of the mesh and she was still in pain. The company appealed the decision and had the amount reduced to $10M.[99] In 2015, Boston Scientific announced it would pay $119 million to 2,970 lawsuit plaintiffs, who had been injured by the mesh.[100] On March 23, 2021, the company agreed to pay $189 million to settle allegations that it had seriously misrepresented the risks related to the vaginal mesh.[101] As of Jan. 27, 2021, around 54,000 lawsuits related to transvaginal meshes had been filed against Boston Scientific.[102]In April 2019, the FDA ordered Boston Scientific and Coloplast to remove all of their vaginal mesh products from the United States market.[101]In 2020, Johnson & Johnson was required to pay $344 million for failing to disclose the serious product risks of its transvaginal mesh product.[101]NIR stent[edit]In 2005, Boston Scientific paid $74 million to settle allegations that it had continued to sell NIR stents (flexible stents) after learning that many of them were defective. Twenty-six injuries and one death may have been caused by malfunctioning stents.[103]Defective defibrillators[edit]Guidant Vitalilty\u2122 AVT\u2122 implantable cardioverter-defibrillator \u2013 Model A135 (The model illustrated was not the subject of the charge.)In 2011, Guidant, a subsidiary of Boston Scientific, was criminally convicted of a failure to report defibrillator safety problems to the FDA.[104] The company was forced to pay more than $296 million in criminal fines and had to submit to the supervision of the U.S. Probation Office for three years. Even though Guidant knew the devices were defective, they continued to sell the defibrillators anyway.[105] Guidant LLC had also advised its sales representatives to tell physicians that nothing was wrong with the defibrillators, and told the FDA that the proposed corrections were not being done to correct life-threatening device flaws, but were rather to improve process throughout. Not until three deaths had occurred and ten months had passed did the company reveal the defects in 2005. The directives for these wrongdoings had been implemented prior to Boston Scientific's acquisition of Guidant in 2006.[106]In 2013, BSC and three of its subsidiaries \u2013 Guidant LLC, Guidant Sales LLC, and Cardiac Pacemakers, Inc. \u2013 agreed to pay $30 million to settle allegations that, according to the Justice Department, between 2002 and 2005, Guidant knowingly sold defective heart devices to health care facilities that in turn implanted the devices into Medicare patients.[107][108]Bribery allegations[edit]Boston Scientific Altrua\u2122 50 Dual-Chamber Cardiac Pacemaker \u2013 Type DDDR; Model S502In 2009, Boston Scientific agreed to pay $22 million to settle allegations that its subsidiary Guidant LLC had used kickback schemes to boost sales for its pacemakers (cardiac rhythm management or CRM devices) and defibrillators (implantable cardioverter-defibrillators or ICD devices). Allegedly, Guidant paid doctors between $1,000 and $1,500 each to participate in one of its four post-studies known as RaCE ($1,500), RaCE II ($1,000), RaCE III ($1,000), and MERITS ($1,000).[109]Obsidio Embolic Recall[edit]In April 2024, the FDA announced a recall of Boston Scientific's device, Obsidio Embolic, which is used to stop hemorrhaging and excessive bleeding. It has been found that when the device is paired with the aliquot technique, it can lead to bowel ischemia, which can mean longer hospitalization or death for patients.[110]Financial restatement[edit]On November 3, 1998, Boston Scientific restated its financial results for 1997, as well as its quarterly results for the first three quarters of 1998, due to the occurrence of business irregularities in the operations of its Japanese subsidiary.[111]Notable people[edit].mw-parser-output .div-col{margin-top:0.3em;column-width:30em}.mw-parser-output .div-col-small{font-size:90%}.mw-parser-output .div-col-rules{column-rule:1px solid #aaa}.mw-parser-output .div-col dl,.mw-parser-output .div-col ol,.mw-parser-output .div-col ul{margin-top:0}.mw-parser-output .div-col li,.mw-parser-output .div-col dd{page-break-inside:avoid;break-inside:avoid-column}Donald Steven Baim, MD (1946\u20132009), served Chief Medical and Scientific Officer for Boston Scientific from 2006 until his death in 2009.Ian Meredith, MD, PhD, AM (born 1956), has been Global Chief Medical Officer and Executive Vice President since January 2017.Ursula Burns (born 1958), who served as a Member of Boston Scientific's 13-seat Board of Directors since 2002, resigned after being named Chief Executive Officer of the Xerox Corporation, taking effect July 1, 2009, and becoming the first African-American female CEO of a Fortune 500 company.Kristina M.

It comes after a turbulent 2024 for health insurers, hurt by lower government payments, soaring medical costs and public backlash after the   of UnitedHealthcare's top executive, Brian Thompson. UnitedHealthcare, the insurance arm of UnitedHealth Group, is the nation's largest provider of those plans. Shares of competitor   fell 5%, while   dropped more than 1% and   tumbled 2%.   has no Medicare Advantage business. Its stock was up almost 1% on Thursday. UnitedHealth's first-quarter results reveal \"ominous signs\" of accelerating medical costs in Medicare Advantage businesses, TD Cowen analyst Ryan Langston said in a note Thursday. He added that the company \"correctly foreshadowed\" increasing medical costs back in 2023, so Thursday's comments \"will call into question\" the full-year outlooks for every insurer.  Higher medical costs have dogged the entire insurance industry over the past year as more seniors return to hospitals to undergo procedures they had delayed during the Covid-19 pandemic, such as joint and hip replacements. But the issue had previously not been as significant at UnitedHealthcare. Barclays analyst Andrew Mok said UnitedHealth's problems may be less of an issue for companies that made \"significant\" exits from some Medicare Advantage markets, including Humana and CVS, according to a note Thursday. Many insurers last year   due to higher medical costs and lower reimbursement rates from the federal government.  Meanwhile, the issue could be a bigger deal for companies that gained greater market share in Medicare Advantage, such as Elevance Health and  , according to Mok. UnitedHealth said the rise in care use, or utilization, in its Medicare Advantage business came in far above what the company planned for the year, which was for care activity to increase at a rate consistent with what it saw in 2024. But trends that became apparent toward the end of the first quarter suggest that care activity increased \"at twice\" that level, UnitedHealth Group CEO Andrew Witty said during an earnings call on Thursday.  The jump was particularly notable in doctor and outpatient services, which do not involve overnight hospital stays, he added.  \"It's very, very unusual,\" Lance Wilkes, Bernstein senior equity analyst,   CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" on Thursday. He said rising utilization is \"really surprising\" coming off the high level of care activity that the industry saw over the past year. Wilkes added that UnitedHealth and the broader industry may be \"pulling back\" the \"intensity of some of the activity they do to manage utilization,\" which causes dissatisfaction among patients. For example, some insurers require prior authorization, which makes providers obtain approval from a patient's insurance company before administering specific treatments. \"I think it's probably United pulling back because of the policy headwinds and the scrutiny on the company,\" Wilkes said. \"I do think the horrible thing that happened to Brian Thompson and the company is a part of this, and I think it's reflective of also the Department of Justice scrutiny on United over the last couple years.\" UnitedHealth is reportedly grappling with a   of its Medicare billing practices. Also on Thursday, UnitedHealth pointed to issues related to changes in the profile of patients treated under its Optum health-care unit. That segment includes its pharmacy benefit manager, which negotiates drug rebates with manufacturers on behalf of insurers and maintains formularies, among other responsibilities.  But Witty said the company is taking action to improve results and considers the issues related to Optum and elevated medical costs \"highly addressable as we look ahead to 2026.\"  If nothing else, insurers are set to get a boost next year. The Trump administration in April said it would   for Medicare Advantage insurers, hiking an earlier proposal from the Biden administration.  ", "summary": null, "related_articles": [], "metadata": {"author": null, "publish_date": "2025-04-17T14:34:59+0000", "read_time": null, "keywords": "Cigna Corp,CVS Health Corp,Alignment Healthcare Inc,Elevance Health Inc,Humana Inc,UnitedHealth Group Inc,Business,Biotechnology,Biotech and Pharmaceuticals,Pharmaceuticals,Health care industry,Breaking News: Business,business news"}, "category": "Health and Science"}

Precision is building a brain-computer interface, or a BCI, which is a system that decodes neural signals and translates them into commands for external technologies. The company's BCI will initially be used to help patients with severe paralysis restore functions such as speech and movement, according to its  . Only part of Precision's system was approved by the FDA on Thursday, but it marks the first full regulatory clearance granted to a company developing a wireless BCI, Precision said in  . Other prominent startups in the space include   Neuralink, and  , which is backed by   founder   and   co-founder  . \"This is a foundational moment for Precision,\" Dr. Benjamin Rapoport, Precision's co-founder and chief science officer, said in a statement. Rapoport also helped co-found Musk's Neuralink in 2017 before departing the following year. The piece of Precision's system that the FDA approved is called the Layer 7 Cortical Interface. The microelectrode array is thinner than a human hair and resembles a piece of yellow scotch tape. Each array is made up of 1,024 electrodes that can record, monitor and stimulate electrical activity on the brain's surface. When it is placed on the brain, Precision says it can conform to the surface without damaging any tissue. The FDA authorized Layer 7 to be implanted in patients for up to 30 days, and Precision will be able to market the technology for use in clinical settings. This means surgeons will be able to use the array during procedures to map brain signals, for instance. It is not Precision's end goal for the technology, but it will help the company generate revenue in the near term.

He proposed a change that the pharmaceutical industry has long sought. In the wide-ranging order, Trump directed Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to work with Congress to modify a piece of the Medicare drug price negotiation rules, which differentiate between small-molecule drugs and biologic medicines. Currently, the law essentially spares biologics like vaccines from new negotiated prices for 13 years after they receive U.S. approval, compared with just nine years for small-molecule drugs that come in a pill or tablet form. The industry contends that the discrepancy – or what drugmakers call the \"pill penalty\" – discourages companies from investing in the development of small-molecule drugs, which are generally cheaper, easier to manufacture and more convenient for patients to take.  Trump's executive order  , saying the discrepancy \"threatens to distort innovation.\" Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle could be receptive to the proposed change, especially after some   last year that also seeks to eliminate the difference.  It could have huge implications for drugmakers, patients and Medicare's spending on prescription drugs. An   from the health policy research organization KFF said the change would mean small-molecule drugs would be on the market longer before they are eligible for negotiations, which could lead to an increase in Medicare prescription drug spending, higher medication prices and steeper premiums in Medicare Part D plans.  Changing the law \"would come at a cost to Medicare and beneficiaries by giving drug companies 4 additional years of setting their own prices on these drugs prior to being eligible for negotiation by the federal government, unless combined with other changes to prevent higher spending,\" the analysis said.  More than half of the drugs – 13 out of 25 – in the first and second rounds of negotiations would have been ineligible at the time they were selected if the discrepancy between small-molecule treatments and biologics didn't exist, according to KFF. Those 13 drugs accounted for about two-thirds of total gross Medicare Part D spending on the 25 treatments, or $61 billion out of $91 billion, KFF said.  That includes the blood thinner Eliquis from   and  , as well as the Type 2 diabetes treatment Jardiance from Eli Lilly and Boehringer Ingelheim.   would be \"among the biggest beneficiaries\" if the pill penalty is removed, according to a Thursday note from TD Cowen analyst Michael Nedelcovych. At the top of the list of drugs   are the company's blockbuster diabetes injection Ozempic, weight loss shot Wegovy and diabetes pill Rybelsus, which are considered one product for the sake of the negotiations since they all share the same active ingredient, semaglutide. Without the so-called pill penalty, Ozempic, Wegovy and Rybelsus would not be eligible until 2031, which is only one year before patent expiration in the U.S., Nedelcovych said.  Trump's   wasn't all good news for pharma. Analysts pointed out that it contained other proposals that the pharmaceutical industry has strongly opposed.  For example, it calls on the Food and Drug Administration to open up a pathway for more drug imports from Canada, where prescription medications are far cheaper. That was an element of Trump's first-term agenda, and appears to clash with his planned tariffs on pharmaceuticals.  In a note on Tuesday, BMO Capital Markets analyst Evan Seigerman added that \"we're also not out of the woods on tariffs, FDA, or the potential for further drug pricing reform.\" He is referring to the massive overhaul at the FDA and other federal health agencies under Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who now leads the Department of Health and Human Services.  \"While we are encouraged with this [executive order,] we're cautious as to what comes next from the Trump Administration for BioPharma,\" Seigerman said.  We'll be sure to cover any of Trump's other moves, so stay tuned.  Feel free to send any tips, suggestions, story ideas and data to Annika at  .

For readers like this health tech reporter who spend a lot of time thinking, researching and talking about the U.S. health-care system, it can be easy to forget that Epic Systems is not a household name for most Americans.  Many people are familiar with Epic because of its patient portal MyChart, but most of them aren't as aware of the central role its technology plays within the broader health-care industry. Epic's software is used by more than 65,000 clinics and 2,900 hospitals, including the vast majority of major health systems in the U.S.  The company is a health-care technology giant, but it's notoriously private, and that's largely by design. Epic has no marketing department and it doesn't advertise, according to its CEO and founder Judy Faulkner. It never has.  To give you a sense of how the company feels about marketing, Epic declared it would replace all of its developers with marketing staff as an   year. \"During its 43-year history of creating award-winning healthcare software, Epic has prided itself on having a staff that's heavily focused on research and development and not focused on marketing. But times are changing, and Epic needs to keep up,\" the fake announcement reads. Faulkner rarely does media appearances, and for the most part, Epic has largely tried to keep its head down over the years.  In recent weeks, however, the company appears to have started to change its posture. Epic started posting on the social media platform X, coincidentally, on April Fools' Day. The company confirmed the authenticity of the account to CNBC.  Seth Hain, senior vice president of research and development at Epic, participated in a podcast with Julie Yoo, general partner at the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, that was released last week. Andreessen Horowitz is one of the most high-profile firms in Silicon Valley, but Epic has never accepted any investment from venture capitalists. And on Monday, the podcast \"Acquired,\" which tells the stories of companies and their founders, released a four-hour-long episode about Epic. The podcast is the No. 1 Technology show on Apple Podcasts and Spotify and reaches more than 1 million listeners, according to its website. It's hard to know exactly how much Epic assisted with the research for the episode, but the hosts do mention that the company confirmed some facts.  Taken together, these developments suggest that Epic is at least exploring a more public-facing persona. To some degree, the company's April Fools' Day prank might actually ring true: \"times are changing, and Epic needs to keep up.\" Feel free to send any tips, suggestions, story ideas and data to Ashley at  .", "summary": null, "related_articles": [], "metadata": {"author": null, "publish_date": "2025-04-22T17:44:24+0000", "read_time": null, "keywords": "Biotech and Pharmaceuticals,Health care industry,Social issues,UnitedHealth Group Inc,Humana Inc,Centene Corp,Elevance Health Inc,Bristol-Myers Squibb Co,Pfizer Inc,Novo Nordisk A/S,Novo Nordisk A/S,Donald Trump,Robert F.

The Food and Drug Administration is phasing out the use of petroleum-based synthetic dyes by the end of next year, the agency announced on Tuesday. \"For the last 50 years, American children have increasingly been living in a toxic soup of synthetic chemicals,\" FDA Commissioner Marty Makary said at a press conference. Food and beverage companies use additives like red dye 40 to give cereal, chips, sports drinks and other products bright hues that attract shoppers. But backlash against artificial colorants has been brewing in the U.S. for more than a decade. The changes will affect a slew of food giants, including  ,  , Mars and  . The industry has argued that the claims about the dangers of artificial dyes lack evidence that would support any bans. As of Tuesday, the FDA and the food industry don't have a formal agreement to remove artificial dyes but instead \"an understanding,\" according to Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. It is unclear what enforcement actions the agency would take if food and beverage companies do not comply. \"There are a number of tools at our disposal,\" Makary said. \"I believe in love, let's start in a friendly way and see if we can do this without any statutory or regulatory changes, but we are exploring every tool in the toolbox to make sure this gets done very quickly. And they want to do it — so why go down a complicated road with Congress?\" The FDA is taking several actions, including setting a \"national standard\" and timeline for the food industry to transition from petroleum-based food dyes to natural alternatives, according to Makary. The agency is also initiating a process to revoke authorization of synthetic food colorings, including those not in production, within the coming weeks. He added that the FDA is also eliminating the remaining six synthetic dyes on the market from the U.S. food supply by the end of the year, specifically red dye 40, yellow dye 5, yellow dye 6, blue dye 1, blue dye 2 and green dye 2. It is also requesting food companies to phase out red dye 3 by the end of next year, which is sooner than the 2027 to 2028 deadline previously announced, according to Makary. \"For companies that are currently using petroleum based red dye, try watermelon juice or beet juice. For companies currently combining petroleum-based yellow chemical and red dyes together, try carrot juice,\" he said.  Makary added that the agency plans to authorize four additional color additives using natural ingredients in the coming weeks, while also expediting the review and approval of other natural ingredient colors. Makary cited a   that concluded that artificial colors in the diet \"result in increased hyperactivity.\" \"The F in FDA stands for food,\" he said. \"Now, there's no one ingredient that accounts for the child chronic disease epidemic. And let's be honest, taking petroleum-based food dyes out of the food supply is not a silver bullet that will instantly make America's children healthy, but it is one important step.\" Last month, Kennedy   that removing artificial dyes from the food system is an urgent priority of the Trump administration. Meeting attendees included the CEOs of PepsiCo North America, Kraft Heinz, General Mills, Tyson Foods, WK Kellogg, J.M. Smucker and the Consumer Brands Association, the industry's top trade group. Kennedy has used Kellogg's Froot Loops as his primary example when railing against artificial colorants. While it is unclear exactly how removing dyes could affect the companies' businesses, it will be a major effort to overhaul recipes — and the new looks could affect how consumers perceive the products. Makary said phasing out petroleum-based food dyes won't increase food prices, pointing to other countries that have made similar moves. However, synthetic dyes are generally more cost-effective than natural alternatives, which often require larger quantities to achieve vibrant colors and can carry higher production costs, according to some  and  . Previously, pushback from consumer advocates led some of the companies to tweak their formulas and drop artificial dyes without any government intervention. In 2015,   changed the recipe of its trademark mac and cheese to use the same natural colors found in the European version of the product. But the changes don't always stick. In 2017,   course, putting its artificially colored Trix cereal back on shelves. The naturally dyed cereal, which used turmeric, radishes and purple carrots, was not as vibrant, and customers rejected the new version. Kennedy is   that oversees food and tobacco products,   and other medicines, scientific research, public health infrastructure and government-funded health care. After just two months on the job, he has drastically changed the nation's federal health agencies.  In March, he announced  to slash 10,000 full-time employees across different departments and consolidate divisions. He has cut back crucial parts of HHS, including offices that handle HIV prevention efforts and work to  . The Food and Drug Administration is also   for testing fluid milk and other dairy products due to reduced capacity in its food safety and nutrition division, Reuters reported on Tuesday. Kennedy's so-called Make America Healthy Again platform argues a corrupt alliance of drug and food companies and the federal health agencies that regulate them are making Americans less healthy. He has pledged to end the chronic disease epidemic in children and adults, and has been vocal about  , rather than drugs, central to that goal. In January, before President Donald Trump or Kennedy took office, the Food and Drug Administration   of one type of red food dye called Red No. 3. The dye is known to cause cancer in laboratory animals, but food manufacturers were allowed to use it for years because scientists didn't believe it raised the risk of cancer in humans at the level it is typically consumed. At least one company is benefitting from the ban on artificial dyes:  , which helps companies tweak their flavors and formulas. \"Now, reformulation activity has always been a part of the work that we do with our customer base, and we've been doing that for quite some time, but we are seeing a tick up in reformulation activity,\" McCormick CEO Brendan Foley told analysts on the company's earnings call in late March, adding that companies are seeking help cutting both artificial colors and sodium from their products.", "summary": null, "related_articles": [], "metadata": {"author": null, "publish_date": "2025-04-22T20:22:17+0000", "read_time": null, "keywords": "Restaurants,Food and drink,Business,Biotechnology,Biotech and Pharmaceuticals,Pharmaceuticals,Health care industry,Breaking News: Business,Social issues,PepsiCo Inc.,Donald Trump,Kraft Heinz Co,General Mills Inc,Tyson Foods Inc,WK Kellogg Co,McCormick & Company Inc,Robert F.

In lawsuits filed Wednesday, Lilly accuses the sites — Mochi Health, Fella Health, Willow Health and Henry Meds — of deceiving consumers about \"untested, unapproved drugs\" and turning them away from Lilly's medicines. Lilly alleges the companies are claiming to offer personalized options when they are actually mass-marketing slightly different versions of Lilly's drugs in order to skirt FDA rules. Lilly also claims some of the sites are selling formulations of the drugs that haven't been studied, such as oral tablets and drops. Fella, Willow and Henry Meds didn't immediately respond to CNBC's requests for comment. Mochi Health in a statement said its model \"remains compliant with FDA guidance and pharmacy regulations.\"  Lilly's diabetes drug Mounjaro went into short supply in late 2022, allowing pharmacies and outsourcing facilities to produce the treatment, a practice called compounding. Novo Nordisk's weight loss drug Wegovy was also in short supply, opening up the market for compounding GLP-1s. That business boomed online, where people sought versions of the treatments if they couldn't find the brand names or couldn't get them covered by insurance. Mass compounding of tirzepatide, the active ingredient in Mounjaro and Zepbound, was supposed to stop last month after the Food and Drug Administration declared the shortage of the drugs over. Some pharmacies kept doing it anyway, producing versions that differ slightly from the brand name, which could possibly keep them out of the FDA's crosshairs. Earlier this month, Lilly   two pharmacies, alleging they falsely marketed their products as personalized versions of the drugs that have been clinically tested and are made using stringent safety standards. One of the telehealth platforms Lilly is now suing, Mochi Health, planned to continue selling compounded versions of tirzepatide, betting that offering personalized treatments would keep it out of legal trouble, Mochi CEO Myra Ahmad   in March. Asked whether she feared legal action from Lilly, Ahmad said she wasn't worried about her prescribers since \"they have established patient-physician relationships\" and \"the beauty of medicine is really that they get full autonomy to decide what is the best way to manage their patients.\" Lilly in its filing Wednesday claimed Ahmad is not a licensed physician and that Mochi and its \"unlicensed owners exercise undue influence and control over, among other things, the prescribing decisions of physicians\" and as a result engage in the \"unlawful corporate practice of medicine.\" Ahmad in a statement said the use of compounded medications \"remains appropriate and legal when tailored to individual patient needs and prescribed by a licensed medical provider\" and that Mochi's physicians choose which treatments are best for their patients. She said she holds a doctor of medicine degree but is not practicing as CEO of Mochi. Lilly makes a similar allegation against Fella Health, accusing the company of making \"sweeping corporate decisions that dictate patient care, such as when Fella changed patients en masse from one tirzepatide formulation to another with additives.\" In all four cases, Lilly is seeking to stop the sites from marketing or selling tirzepatide.

The company now expects its 2025 adjusted earnings to come in between $8.82 and $8.97, down slightly from a previous outlook of $8.88 to $9.03 per share. The company said the expected tariff charge primarily reflects levies between the U.S. and China, and Canada and Mexico to a lesser degree. Merck has built a robust presence in China, which is considered one of the company's most important markets and is home to some of its partners and manufacturing and research and development sites.  Merck noted that the new outlook does not account for President  's planned tariffs on pharmaceuticals imported into the U.S., which are prompting some drugmakers to   footprints.  That includes Merck, which has invested $12 billion in U.S. manufacturing and research and development and expects to put more than $9 billion more into the country by the end of 2028. On an earnings call on Thursday, Merck CEO Rob Davis said that \"as you look at 2025, we're well positioned with inventory to be able to mitigate anything we could see in the short term.\" He added that in the medium to long term, \"we've already started to identify where we can either reposition our own manufacturing,\" which could look like changing the priorities of existing plants, or bring on external manufacturing to \"bridge gaps\" and build internal production further. \"In many ways, we are aligned with what the administration is wanting to do, and feel that we're in position to be able to do that quite effectively,\" he said. The new guidance does include a one-time charge of roughly 6 cents per share related to the company's license agreement with Hengrui Pharma, which it   in March. Merck reiterated its full-year sales forecast of between $64.1 billion and $65.6 billion.  Also on Thursday, the drugmaker reported first-quarter revenue and profit that beat expectations, as it said it saw strength in its oncology portfolio and animal health products.  Merck also cited \"increasingly meaningful\" sales contributions from two recently launched drugs. They are Winrevair, which is used to treat a rare, deadly lung condition, and Capvaxive, a vaccine designed to protect adults from a bacteria known as pneumococcus that can cause serious illnesses and lung infection.  Sales of those drugs will likely be critical to Merck's efforts to offset losses from its top-selling cancer therapy Keytruda, which will lose exclusivity in 2028.  Here's what Merck reported for the first quarter compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:  The company posted net income of $5.08 billion, or $2.01 per share, for the quarter. That compares with net income of $4.76 billion, or $1.87 per share, during the year-earlier period.  Excluding acquisition and restructuring costs, Merck earned $2.22 per share for the first quarter.  Merck raked in $15.53 billion in revenue for the quarter, down 2% from the same period a year ago. Merck's pharmaceutical unit, which develops a wide range of drugs, booked $13.64 billion in revenue during the first quarter. That's down 3% from the same period a year ago. Keytruda recorded $7.21 billion in revenue during the quarter, up just 4% from the year-earlier period.  That increase was driven by higher uptake of Keytruda for earlier-stage cancers and strong demand for the drug for metastatic cancers, which spread to other parts of the body. Still, sales came under the $7.43 billion that analysts had expected, according to StreetAccount estimates.   Notably, Merck continued to see   of Gardasil, a vaccine that prevents cancer from HPV, the most common sexually transmitted infection in the U.S.  In February, Merck announced a decision to halt shipments of Gardasil into China beginning that month and going through at least mid-2025. Investors will likely be looking for updates on that effort during the earnings call on Thursday.  The Chinese market makes up the majority of the blockbuster shot's international revenue. Merck is hoping that Gardasil's expanded approval for men ages 9 to 26 in China will help boost uptake of the vaccine. Gardasil raked in $1.33 billion in sales, down 41% from the first quarter of 2024 primarily due to lower demand in China. That's below the $1.45 billion that analysts were expecting, according to StreetAccount estimates.  China has retaliated with tariffs of 125% on goods from the U.S. Some experts said China's tariffs on U.S. products could lead to increased prices or limited supply of some popular Western medicines for Chinese patients, Reuters  . Merck's animal health division, which develops vaccines and medicines for dogs, cats and cattle, posted nearly $1.59 billion in sales, up 5% from the same period a year ago.

The company now expects 2025 revenue to come in between $45.8 billion and $46.8 billion, up from a   of around $45.5 billion. Bristol Myers also projects full-year adjusted earnings of $6.70 to $7 per share, which compares with its prior forecast of $6.55 to $6.85 per share.  Notably, the company said its guidance revisions include the estimated impact of current tariffs on U.S. products shipped to China. China is a critical market for Bristol Myers. The company has   its \"China 2030 Strategy,\" which is a   to bring more of its medicines to the nation to address unmet medical needs in areas like gastric cancer and include more Chinese patients in clinical trials. But the new outlooks do not account for any of President  s planned tariffs on pharmaceuticals imported into the U.S., Bristol Myers said.  In an earnings call Thursday, Bristol Myers Squibb CEO Christopher Boerner said the company appreciated the Trump administration's efforts to increase U.S. manufacturing, but noted that it \"needs to be done in a very thoughtful and deliberate way\" in the pharmaceutical sector. He added that it is \"simply too early to provide a lot more\" on the company's expectations for pharmaceutical-specific tariffs. Still, Bristol Myers is continuing \"mitigation efforts\" to reduce risks of any disruption to the supply chain and shortages, Boerner said. \"We have a tremendous amount of flexibility to be able to move our manufacturing around should any potential tariffs come up,\" said the company's CFO David Elkins on the call. He added that Bristol Myers has a broad global manufacturing network, which includes a significant presence in the U.S. Bristol Myers said the outlook hike reflects strength in its portfolio of newer drug brands, and better-than-anticipated first-quarter sales from its legacy portfolio of older medications.  The results come as Bristol Myers moves to slash $2 billion in expenses by the end of 2027, which is on top of $1.5 billion in planned cost cuts by the end of this year.  It also comes just days after Bristol Myers' recently approved schizophrenia drug, Cobenfy,  , leading some Wall Street analysts to substantially lower their multibillion-dollar sales forecasts for the treatment.   The company is banking on Cobenfy and other so-called growth portfolio drugs to offset the loss in revenue from top-selling treatments slated to lose exclusivity on the market, including its blockbuster blood thinner Eliquis and cancer immunotherapy Opdivo.  Boerner said \"there's a lot of uncertainty, whether related to tariffs, a potential economic downturn or restructuring at the FDA and HHS.\" He is referring to the Trump administration's efforts to   the Food and Drug Administration and other federal health agencies under the Department of Health and Human Services. But the company remains confident in its ability \"to deliver for our patients, employees and shareholders,\" he said. Here is what Bristol Myers reported for the first quarter compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:  Bristol Myers posted net income of $2.5 billion, or $1.20 per share, for the first quarter. That compares with a net loss of $11.9 billion, or a loss of $5.89 per share, for the year-earlier period.  Excluding certain items, it reported adjusted earnings per share of $1.80 for the quarter.  The pharmaceutical giant's revenue fell 6% from the same period a year ago to $11.2 billion.  Eliquis booked $3.57 billion in sales for the quarter, down 4% from the year-ago period. That is above the $3.34 billion that analysts were expecting, according to estimates compiled by StreetAccount. The blood thinner, which Bristol Myers shares with  , is expected to lose market exclusivity by 2028.  Sales of Eliquis could also take a hit in 2026, when a   for the drug goes into effect for certain Medicare patients following negotiations with the federal government. Those price talks are a key provision of the Inflation Reduction Act. The   targets 15 additional drugs and will set new prices that will go into effect in 2028. That includes the Bristol Myers medication Pomalyst, which is used to treat a blood cancer called multiple myeloma and a different cancer that develops in people with HIV. Pomalyst brought in $658 million for the period, down 24% from a year earlier. Revlimid, a drug used to treat adults with multiple myeloma, took in $936 million in sales for the first quarter, down 44% from the same period a year ago.   Revenue from the company's so-called growth portfolio was $5.56 billion for the first quarter, up 16% from the year-earlier period.  Opdivo brought in $2.27 billion in revenue for the first quarter, rising 9% from the year-earlier period.

That came in response to a February lawsuit from a compounding trade group against the Food and Drug Administration's determination that the active ingredient in those drugs, semaglutide, is no longer in shortage in the U.S. Patients flocked to the cheaper copycats when Ozempic and Wegovy were in short supply over the last two years due to skyrocketing demand, or if they didn't have insurance coverage for the costly treatments.  During  , pharmacists can legally make compounded versions of brand-name medications.

But drugmakers and some health experts have pushed back against the practice because the FDA does not approve compounded drugs, which are essentially custom-made copies prescribed by a doctor to meet a specific patient's needs.  \"We are pleased the court has rejected the compounders' attempts to undermine FDA's data-based decision that the shortage\" of semaglutide is resolved, said Steve Benz, Novo Nordisk's corporate vice president, legal and U.S. general counsel, in a statement.  \"Patient safety remains a top priority for Novo Nordisk and the extensive nationwide legal actions we have taken to protect Americans from the health risks posed by illegitimate 'semaglutide' drugs are working,\" he said, referring to the company's more than 100 lawsuits against compounding pharmacies and other entities across 32 states.  On Thursday, U.S. District Judge Mark Pittman specifically denied the Outsourcing Facilities Association's bid for a preliminary injunction that would have prevented the FDA from taking action against its members for making copies of semaglutide.  That decision upholds the FDA's previous determination that the semaglutide shortage in the U.S. is over and means the FDA can now immediately go after so-called 503A pharmacies that are making compounded versions of semaglutide according to individual prescriptions for a specific patient. Those pharmacies are largely regulated by states rather than the FDA. The decision also means the FDA can start targeting federally regulated 503B pharmacies, which manufacture compounded drugs in bulk with or without prescriptions, after May 22. The agency's actions can include product seizures and warning letters to pharmacies.  The decision on Thursday follows another win for Novo Nordisk. A different federal judge in Texas earlier this week ruled in favor of the drugmaker against a 503A pharmacy, MediOak Pharmacy, permanently prohibiting the business from marketing or selling compounded semaglutide. Novo Nordisk and   have aggressively cracked down on compounding pharmacies over the last two years as they benefit from the soaring popularity of their weight loss and diabetes drugs. Eli Lilly has gone through a   with tirzepatide, the active ingredient in its weight loss drug Zepbound and diabetes treatment Mounjaro. The FDA declared the U.S. shortage of tirzepatide over last year, prompting the same compounding trade group to sue the FDA over the drug.  In March, a federal judge denied the compounding group's request for a preliminary injunction on the FDA's enforcement against its members for making copies of Mounjaro and Zepbound. The compounding group has appealed.", "summary": null, "related_articles": [], "metadata": {"author": null, "publish_date": "2025-04-25T14:07:25+0000", "read_time": null, "keywords": "Breaking News: Business,Health care industry,Pharmaceuticals,Biotech and Pharmaceuticals,Biotechnology,Business,United States,Donald Trump,Novo Nordisk A/S,Social issues,Novo Nordisk A/S,LILLY DRN,Hims & Hers Health Inc,business news"}, "category": "Health and Science"}

The company previously said its cost-cutting program would deliver overall net cost savings of roughly $4.5 billion by the end of 2025. On Tuesday, Pfizer said it now expects additional savings of roughly $1.2 billion, primarily in selling, informational and administrative expenses, by the end of 2027.  The company said that will be driven in large part by \"enhanced digital enablement,\" including automation and artificial intelligence and streamlining business processes. The expanded cuts also include expected research and development reorganization cost savings of around $500 million by the end of 2026, the company added. Those savings will be reinvested into Pfizer's product pipeline.  Pfizer has a  to slash costs, with the first phase of the effort slated to deliver $1.5 billion in savings by the end of 2027. With the added cuts announced Tuesday, Pfizer now expects to deliver around $7.7 billion in savings by the end of that year from the two cost-cutting efforts. The cuts aim to help the pharmaceutical giant recover from the rapid decline of its Covid business and stock price over the last few years, and appear to be paying off. Here's what the company reported for the   compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:  The results come as drugmakers brace for President  's planned tariffs on pharmaceuticals imported into the U.S. – his administration's bid to boost U.S. manufacturing of medications.  Unlike other companies grappling with evolving trade policy, Pfizer did not revise its outlook. The company maintained its full-year 2025 outlook, forecasting sales of $61 billion to $64 billion, with a similar performance from its Covid products as seen in 2024, however Pfizer noted in its earnings release that the guidance \"does not currently include any potential impact related to future tariffs and trade policy changes, which we are unable to predict at this time.\" But on the earnings call on Tuesday, Pfizer executives said the guidance does reflect $150 million in costs from Trump's existing tariffs. \"Included in our guidance that we didn't really speak about is there are some tariffs in place today,\" Pfizer CFO Dave Denton said on the call. \"We are contemplating that within our guidance range and we continue to again trend to the top end of our guidance range even with those costs to be incurred this year,\" he said. On the call, Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla said the company established a team to analyze a range of potential outcomes and develop strategies to help mitigate the potential impact of tariffs on its business in the short and long term. That team is managing current inventory levels in certain jurisdictions and leveraging Pfizer's domestic manufacturing footprint, among other efforts. \"Should we be impacted by further tariffs in the future, we will assess the impact of the policies enacted and provide information at the appropriate time,\" Bourla said. He added that uncertainty around Trump's pharmaceutical tariffs is deterring the company from further investing in U.S. manufacturing and research and development. Pfizer still expects that   resulting from the Inflation Reduction Act will hurt sales by $1 billion, dampening growth by approximately 1.6% compared with 2024. Stripping out one-time items, the company expects 2025 earnings to be in the range of $2.80 to $3 a share.  \"With the underlying strength of our business, we believe we can be agile in navigating an uncertain and volatile external environment,\" Bourla said in a release. For the first quarter, the company booked net income of $2.97 billion, or 52 cents per share. That compares with net income of $3.12 billion, or 55 cents per share, during the same period a year ago.  Excluding certain items, including restructuring charges and costs associated with intangible assets, the company posted earnings per share of 92 cents for the quarter. Pfizer reported revenue of $13.72 billion for the first quarter, down 8% from the same period a year ago. The company said the decrease in sales was primarily driven by a decline in revenue for Paxlovid, which posted $491 million in sales during the first quarter, down 76% from the same period a year ago, in part due to lower Covid infections worldwide and reduced international government purchases of the drug. The drop in sales also reflects a boost Pfizer got in the first quarter of 2024 from a final adjustment related to a previously recorded revenue reversal for Paxlovid.  Analysts had expected Paxlovid to generate $769.7 million in sales for the first quarter, according to StreetAccount estimates. Meanwhile, the company's Covid shot, Comirnaty, booked $565 million in revenue, up 60% from the same period a year ago. That's above the $352 million that analysts were expecting, according to StreetAccount. The results come as shot makers like Pfizer face uncertainty over immunization policy and regulation under Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a prominent vaccine skeptic who now oversees the nation's federal health agencies. As secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, Kennedy has pursued a sweeping overhaul of different agencies, cutting staff, consolidating or eliminating offices and taking actions that could ultimately undermine vaccines.", "summary": null, "related_articles": [], "metadata": {"author": null, "publish_date": "2025-04-29T10:59:28+0000", "read_time": null, "keywords": "Breaking News: Earnings,Earnings,Pfizer Inc,Business,Biotechnology,Biotech and Pharmaceuticals,Pharmaceuticals,Health care industry,Breaking News: Business,Dividends,United States,Albert Bourla,Donald J.

The Danish drugmaker is racing to capture more patients now that many compounding pharmacies are legally restricted from making cheaper, unapproved versions of  , with rare exceptions. Patients flocked to those compounded versions while Wegovy was in shortage due to skyrocketing demand.  \"We felt it was really important to work hard to establish a collaboration with telehealth companies so that there could be access to Wegovy as the compounding is winding down,\" Dave Moore, executive vice president of U.S. operations at Novo Nordisk, told CNBC.  \"We're really pleased about the level of interest to access branded Wegovy and to start to sort of catch people as they come off of compounded medicine,\" he said.  Moore added that the new partnerships make the experience \"seamless\" for patients since it allows them to access Wegovy straight from their telehealth providers, which \"makes it very easy\" for them to get the drug shipped directly to their homes.  Patients will be able to access Novo Nordisk's new direct-to-consumer online pharmacy,  , directly through the   providers.  That pharmacy offers Wegovy for $499 in cash per month – roughly half its usual monthly list price  – for patients without insurance coverage for the weekly injection.  Each telehealth company's price may be higher because they likely include additional services, a Novo Nordisk spokesperson told CNBC.  Hims & Hers said it will begin offering all dose sizes of Wegovy along with access to 24/7 care, nutritional guidance and ongoing clinical support this week, starting at $599 per month to eligible cash-paying patients with a prescription.  The medication will cost Hims & Hers customers more since it comes with added access to care, the company's CEO, Andrew Dudum, told CNBC in an interview. He said he thinks the company's partnership with Novo Nordisk will serve as a case study for how patients get access to and get prices for \"great medicine\" and other forms of treatment.  Ro opted for the lower price, announcing Tuesday it will offer access to all doses of Wegovy for $499 per month. The company provides 24/7 messaging, one-on-one coaching, educational content and more through its monthly membership called the Body Program, which does not include the cost of medication. \"Adding Novo Nordisk's FDA-approved treatments at the best available cash price will help more patients nationwide get the obesity care they need to achieve their goals, particularly those without insurance coverage,\" Ro CEO Zach Reitano said in a release. Earlier this month, Hims & Hers   that patients could access  's weight loss medication   and diabetes drug  , as well as the generic injection liraglutide, through its platform. But unlike the company's collaboration with Novo Nordisk,   released a statement clarifying that it has \"no affiliation\" with Hims & Hers. Hims & Hers started prescribing compounded semaglutide, the active ingredient in  's diabetes drug Ozempic and Wegovy, in May of 2024. The company has largely had to stop offering the compounded medications en masse, but some consumers may still be able to access personalized doses if it's clinically applicable, Dudum said.  \"That was one of the first things we shared with Novo is that we will always fight on behalf of what consumers we believe have the right to get,\" Dudum said. \"The regulation is very clear.\"  During  , pharmacists can legally make compounded versions of brand-name medications. They can also be produced on a case-by-case basis when it's medically necessary for a patient, such as when they can't swallow a pill or are allergic to a specific ingredient in a branded drug.  But drugmakers and some health experts have pushed back against the practice, largely because the FDA does not approve compounded drugs.  Larger, federally regulated compounding pharmacies that make copies of semaglutide in bulk without prescriptions face a legal deadline of May 22 to stop marketing and selling those versions. Smaller, state-licensed compounding pharmacies that manufacture semaglutide copycats for individual prescriptions had a deadline of April 22.   \"The spirit of this is that we stay true to what the rules are,\" Moore said. \"That's the best way for us to serve patients.\"", "summary": null, "related_articles": [], "metadata": {"author": null, "publish_date": "2025-04-29T11:52:16+0000", "read_time": null, "keywords": "Breaking News: Business,Health care industry,Pharmaceuticals,Biotech and Pharmaceuticals,Biotechnology,Business,Novo Nordisk A/S,Hims & Hers Health Inc,Novo Nordisk A/S,business news"}, "category": "Health and Science"}

Twenty-five years later, the company is still serving women, \"a lot of women,\" Strober says. She was a pregnant venture investor at the time she made the BabyCenter investment, and it helped to spark a bigger idea: for too long, she says, the storyline for women facing challenges has been \"just deal with it.\" \"It's a weird thing ... and that's just really unhealthy, and we have to change that,\" Strober said at the recent CNBC Changemakers Summit in Los Angeles. For Chelsea Hirschhorn, having her first child led her to become \"totally disillusioned\" with the chasm between the image of new parenthood that was marketed and the reality she experienced. \"The picture-perfect image of parenting was overwhelming for a new parent,\" she said. \"There was a big dichotomy between the content I was consuming and the front-line experience at 3 a.m.\" Hirschhorn says there was no data available at the time to substantiate what she felt because the topic was understudied and underfunded, so she \"took on\" the category of infant health and wellness. \"For whatever reason,\" Hirschhorn says, she had \"the conviction to think I could fix this.\" While there is a distinction between the health challenges the two female CEO and founders focus on — not every woman will become pregnant but all will go through menopause — one big idea binds the two women leaders together: products, treatments and services exist that can meet critical needs in an underserved, and undervalued, market. \"We have this idea that perimenopause is at a certain time and people think they have to suffer for a really long time before they get the right care, but what we say is you don't have to suffer at all,\" Strober shared at the Changemakers Summit. \"As soon as you're in your 30s and anything starts feeling wrong, you should get help. The idea of suffering is really outdated,\" she said. \"Women have been trained to suffer for far too long.\"  and   were both named to the  . (Actress and entrepreneur  , who has become a leading advocate for menopause health as founder and chief creative officer at Stripes Beauty after struggling with early menopause at the height of her early Hollywood fame, was also among the 2025 Changemakers.) At the Changemakers Summit on April 8, the two women CEOs shared advice and lessons from their successes bringing new business ideas to health care. Here are a few of the key themes they touched on in a discussion with CNBC's Kate Rooney. In addition to \"the dearth of information\" that exists to prepare women for the reality of parenthood, educational content for women has been censored when on topics related to reproductive health. That was something that Hirschhorn learned once she started Frida, a time when it was \"almost impossible,\" she says, to find authentic storytelling on the subject matter, and led her to create  . \"Sixty percent of women's health ads content, or content in general, has been in some way, shape or form, rejected or filtered,\" she said. That's not just online but on linear television, part of what Hirschhorn calls a \"very gendered dichotomy,\" citing the fact that male health and sexual wellness content is approved at a significantly higher rate. That leaves her \"incredulous,\" she said, and it is a call to action to shift from women's health being a topic of provocation to a topic of public health. \"Women have to advocate for themselves,\" she said. \"Women can't be complacent, and this goes beyond health care. This can drive real change, in retail ... in every facet of life,\" she added. Strober noted that when she was building Midi Health it became clear that a major challenge would be working with codes created by the insurance industry for menopause, in effect, another form of institutional censorship. Midi Health decided to position itself as an in-network primary care provider that had a specialty in menopause and that turned out to be a \"really effective\" way to gain traction, she says, and it now has nationwide insurance coverage with all the large insurance companies in the U.S. \"They are not necessarily going to cover sexual health issues but they will cover primary care, so you just subsume it,\" she explained. By viewing menopause as just part of women's health, she says, the company was able to create a reimbursement mechanism that meets insurance standards. That insurance coverage is a very big deal, because research is showing that lack of menopause treatment can have a high cost when it comes to women's careers.   Strober pointed to during the Changemakers discussion found that at the mid-career moment when women should be gaining their greatest successes in the workplace, the shift into menopause can hold them back. Strober said the growing body of research details how menopause can result in discrimination at work, with women quitting jobs, or not going for raises or promotions because of symptoms, and also because they don't believe they can get the treatment that they need. \"If you believe that you have something that can't be fixed, it's very embarrassing, and that means people step back from what they are doing,\" Strober said. \"They are scared,\" she added. That can be the experience that is called brain fog, and also hot flashes. \"You lose power during hot flashes,\" Strober said. \"People are not as confident. But if you are getting treated for it, 'it's just a hot flash' and you can regain power,\" she added. Hirschhorn says that by the numbers, there is still huge potential in the women's health market. It is estimated to grow to $60 billion by 2027, according to data she cited at the event, and that is despite the fact that less than 4% of health-care R&D spending and investment goes to the category — a \"seismic gap,\" she said. It is a well-known fact in consumer research that women dominate household spending, but Hirschhorn said in Frida's market there is a \"viral\" opportunity that is underappreciated. \"Creating products for women based on real need creates a virality that is hard to recreate with other demographics,\" she said. \"These women aren't just buying their products, they are selling them to their communities and friends. We call that 'word of mom,\" Hirschhorn said. \"It's a really big untapped opportunity,\" she added. As a former venture investor, Strober said it is important to accept that \"people are not dying to invest in women's health,\" but she added that when you can show the growth that companies like Midi Health are posting, that won't slow a company down. \"We are the fastest-growing digital health company, probably ever, quite honestly,\" she said. \"We are growing insanely fast because women really need access to this care and can't get it elsewhere,\" she added. Similar to the \"virality\" experienced by Frida, Strober says the business model does build on itself. \"Once you take care of one thing for women they come back to you for something else, and if you develop this trusted platform for them, where they become your long-term patient, that is a good business,\" she said. \"We don't say it's a women's business, we say it's a really good business,\" she added. That opportunity and the unfiltered realities of parenthood have now grown Frida to more than 150 products, covering everything from conception to post-partum and breastfeeding care, and beyond. \"My four children are a hotbed of inspiration and my 'snot sucking' days are almost over,\" Hirschhorn said. But she added, \"The same problems exist, you just need a different toolkit.\" At Midi Health, Strober says the next big opportunity to unlock is making connections between menopause health and longevity. \"If you take care of yourself in your 40s you can really prevent a lot of the diseases that come in your 80s, and so we have been thinking a lot about this longevity market,\" Strober said. \"It's all bros, all the bros who are out there and talking about wanting to live to 150. We just want to take care of ourselves. We don't care about living to 150. We just want to be healthy grandmas,\" she said. \"What do we do, how do we take care of our brains and bones and hearts to age in a healthy way?\" Strober asks. She says there are many treatments, products and services yet to be developed by health companies that will help women in their 40s, 50s and 60s to better answer that question.", "summary": null, "related_articles": [], "metadata": {"author": null, "publish_date": "2025-04-29T19:23:50+0000", "read_time": null, "keywords": "Menopause,Health,Gender issues,Health care industry,Health insurance,Suppress Zephr,Social issues,business news"}, "category": "Health and Science"}

For many, the big question is whether the pricey medications known as GLP-1s will pay off by improving worker health and lowering overall health costs over time. Analysts at Aon say it's already happening.   \"We've never seen anything like this, really,\" said Greg Case, CEO of  , an employer benefits services firm. \"There was a 44% reduction in major cardiovascular issues. There was substantial reduction in osteoporosis. There was substantial reduction in pneumonia of multiple types.\" Aon researchers found that within two years, patients taking GLP-1 drugs saw improved health outcomes, which significantly slowed the growth rate of their medical costs. The rate of growth, known as the medical cost trend – was cut roughly in half, the researchers said.     GLP-1s come at a list price of more than $1,000 per dose. As broader approval for the drugs spurs higher demand, it's also causing employer drug spending to spike.

Aon analysts looked at medical claims data for 139,000 U.S.-based workers with employer health coverage who took GLP-1 medications between 2022 and 2024. Beyond the drug costs, the study found GLP-1 patients tend to incur higher medical costs in their first year on the drugs, with more doctor visits to monitor their treatment on the drug and to seek help for other issues such as sleep apnea and esophageal conditions like acid reflux. \"The increase comes about in the first 12 to 15 months,\" Case said. \"They're getting remedies on things that actually are underlying conditions [of obesity].\" But by the end of the second year of treatment with the GLP-1 drugs, the medical cost trend for patients taking them slowed by 7% on average, compared to workers with similar chronic conditions and obesity characteristics who were not taking the drugs, Aon found. For those not taking the drug, the medical cost trend was 14%. The biggest driver of those savings was the reduction by more than 40% of major adverse cardiac events such as heart attacks and strokes, compared with patients who were not taking the drugs, as well as a reduction in the onset of diabetes.  Case said with this data, Aon has been able to help clients understand the timeline for seeing a return on providing insurance coverage for GLP-1s for weight loss, in addition to Type 2 diabetes. \"We saw every single place where the cost went down — and it's stunning,\" said Case. \"You can do this in a way that has an ROI, that will literally be an economic return.\" Following its research, Aon has launched a subsidized GLP-1 weight management program for its own U.S. workforce, which includes weekly virtual wellness visits and home blood tests to help employees adhere to the drug regimen.

For its full year, GE HealthCare said it expects to report adjusted earnings in the range of $3.90 to $4.10 per share, which is a decline of 13% to 9% from its guide last quarter. The company said the range includes roughly 85 cents per share of tariff impact. \"Regarding the current global trade environment, we are actively driving mitigation actions,\" GE HealthCare CEO Peter Arduini said in a statement. \"We continue to see strong customer demand in many of the markets we serve and are well-positioned to drive long-term value as we invest in future innovation.\" GE HealthCare sells a range of medical technology, pharmaceutical diagnostics, imaging solutions, artificial intelligence tools and data analytics solutions. The company manufactures its products in 20 countries and serves customers in more than 160 nations around the globe, according to its website. On April 2, Trump introduced his tariff policy, which initially established a 10% baseline levy on almost every country, though many nations such as China, Vietnam and Taiwan were subject to much steeper rates.

Kennedy Jr.'s   of the Department of Health and Human Services involves deep cuts to several divisions that help protect and improve the health of minority and underserved populations and eliminate health disparities in the U.S., CNBC has learned. Kennedy, the Health and Human Services secretary, has gutted at least seven minority health offices across the department, according to people familiar with the matter, who requested anonymity to speak freely. HHS has laid off a significant share of workers at those offices, or in some cases all of them, along with their directors, the people said. The affected units include the HHS Office of Minority Health and the National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities, or  . The cuts also hit offices with similar functions at the Food and Drug Administration, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, the Health Resources and Services Administration, and the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, according to the people.  Health policy experts told CNBC that deep cuts to those divisions could widen existing health disparities in the U.S., undoing years of progress toward addressing them. Over time, that could worsen health outcomes for already underserved groups, threaten overall public health, strain the U.S. health-care system and drive up health-care costs.  \"It will have negative health impacts, obviously, for groups that they're focused on, so racial and ethnic minorities, but I think what gets missed in the story is it ultimately impacts all of us, no matter what your background is,\" Dr. Stephanie Ettinger De Cuba, research professor of health law, policy and management at Boston University, told CNBC.  \"It's not a zero-sum game. So I think that's what is deeply disturbing to me, as we are going to see people get hurt,\" she said. \"Decimating or cutting staff from these offices ultimately makes it worse for everyone.\" The Trump administration can't shutter the affected offices entirely, which would   since they were authorized by the Affordable Care Act more than a decade ago, the people said. The exact fate of each office and the NIH institute is unclear, they added.  The administration likely hopes to at least \"narrow the scope\" of what NIMHD and the agency offices do, curtailing their authority and limiting resources, said Brandyn Churchill, professor of public administration and policy at American University.  The cuts come as health disparities remain a major challenge in the U.S., affecting not only people of color but also rural residents, low-income communities and individuals with disabilities, among several other groups. These communities often face worse health outcomes – such as lower life expectancy and higher rates of infant mortality and chronic disease – and more limited access to care and other resources than the U.S. population as a whole.  The Covid-19 pandemic deepened many of these gaps, highlighting how the long U.S. history of exclusionary policies and systemic issues such as poverty and racism contribute to unequal health outcomes across the country.  Health policy experts stress that addressing those disparities leads to stronger overall public health, as healthier communities improve outcomes for everyone. It could also relieve a huge economic burden on the U.S: a   found that racial and ethnic health disparities cost the U.S. economy $451 billion in 2018.   Kennedy is consolidating divisions and slashing 10,000 jobs at HHS,   that oversees vaccines and other medicines, scientific research, public health infrastructure, pandemic preparedness, and food and tobacco products. HHS also manages government-funded health care for millions of Americans – including seniors, disabled people and lower-income patients who rely on Medicare, Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act's markets. Kennedy plans to create a new HHS agency called the Administration for a Healthy America, which will combine several existing offices. That includes HRSA, SAMHSA, the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Health, the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry, and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health. A leaked 64-page preliminary budget document also indicates that the HHS Office of Minority Health would fall under that new agency, according to several reports. But that proposal, which would slash the HHS budget by a third, or roughly $40 billion, requires congressional approval.  HHS did not immediately respond to a request for comment. While the breadth of the cutbacks varied at agencies within HHS, the minority health agencies across the departments will now be only a fraction of their former size. All 40 staff members at the CMS Office of Minority Health were laid off, according to the people. CMS plans to appoint a new director for that unit, but the current director has not resigned from the role, CNBC previously  .  The office works with local and federal partners to eliminate disparities in health coverage, aiming to ensure that minority and underserved populations can access Medicare, Medicaid and Affordable Care Act marketplace plans. It also conducts research and analysis to help lower costs and reduce the incidence and severity of chronic diseases in the U.S.  Nearly all staff at the CDC's Office of Minority Health were cut, according to the people. To adhere to the letter of the law, the Trump administration is considering reconstituting that unit and the Office of Women's Health so that each office would be made up of at least one director or a very small group of employees, the people said.  The agency's Office of Minority Health works across CDC to promote research of health disparities and create programs to improve the health of racial and ethnic minority groups. At the FDA's Office of Minority Health and Health Equity, all staff were cut, the people said. The future of that office is unclear.  The unit focuses on efforts such as increasing clinical trial diversity, improving transparency around how medical products affect different populations, and creating health resources tailored to a range of languages and cultures. No staff are left at HRSA's Office of Health Equity after the layoffs, as well as some retirements and reassignments, according to the people. That office leads efforts to reduce disparities in health-care access, quality and outcomes through HRSA, which focuses on people who are uninsured, geographically isolated, or economically and medically vulnerable. The future of that office is also unclear, apart from the Trump administration's plans to fold HRSA into Kennedy's new agency. The same goes for SAMHSA's , which saw all remaining staff cut except for a new, recently hired director, according to the people. The office also had a retirement and one worker on probation who was put on administrative leave.  The office works to ensure that SAMHSA's resources for mental health and substance abuse treatment, including grant programs and other initiatives, are equitably distributed across all communities and populations. Roughly a third of staff are gone at NIMHD, some of whom were laid off and others who left due to early retirements and buyouts, the people said. Some workers on probation were put on leave several weeks before Kennedy started cuts, they said.  The institute's deputy director accepted an offer to be acting director in the short term, the people added. NIMHD, which is part of the National Institutes of Health, works to reduce health disparities through conducting and funding research and developing new programs. The HHS Office of Minority Health also faced cuts, though it's unclear how many staff were impacted, the people said. That office leads the federal effort to improve health outcomes for racial and ethnic minority groups, developing policies and programs and providing funding. It will likely take several months to a year before the U.S. sees direct consequences from the cuts to NIMHD and the offices, said Terry McGovern, professor at the CUNY Graduate School of Public Health and Health Policy. But the staff reductions could cause the U.S. to lose out on crucial data, which is the cornerstone for addressing health disparities, according to Samantha Artiga, director for the racial equity and health policy program at KFF, a health policy research organization.  Artiga said data and research are essential for pinpointing where disparities exist, understanding their root causes, crafting effective solutions, and tracking progress over time. For example, data can reveal whether certain groups experience worse surgical outcomes or wait longer at the emergency room, or if a vaccination program is being equitably distributed across regions. \"Without focused data and research, those disparities may remain unseen and unaddressed, creating blind spots,\" Artiga said, adding that the U.S. would eventually have to rebuild that knowledge in the future.  The fate of many of the grants that NIMHD and some of the offices provide is unclear. That includes  from HHS' Office of Minority Health to 20 organizations for a four-year initiative to identify strategies that increase the use of preventive health services in communities.  But if offices cut back that funding or stop it altogether, it could also weaken the nation's ability to reduce health disparities, Boston University's Ettinger De Cuba said.  Community-based organizations rely on federal money to deliver culturally tailored care to different groups, and could be forced to scale back or shut down programs. The loss of grants could also stall research, innovation and public health interventions by outside entities, such as universities, health-care systems and social service organizations.  \"Philanthropy is not able to step up at this level long term. The only actor that's able to do that is the government,\" Ettinger De Cuba said.  Nathan Boucher, research professor at Duke's Sanford School of Public Policy, added that the cuts will \"degrade any effort of these larger governmental organizations to have any accountability when it comes to protecting the people they help and serve every day.\"  While Kennedy has said his cuts are focused on making HHS more \"responsive and efficient,\" Boucher said targeting minority health offices could do the opposite.  \"I actually think it's an efficiency argument to be able to have these minority health offices, because it allows you to identify and target some real problem areas and use taxpayer dollars in the most efficient way possible,\" said Boucher. ", "summary": null, "related_articles": [], "metadata": {"author": null, "publish_date": "2025-04-30T16:42:17+0000", "read_time": null, "keywords": "Breaking News: Politics,Business,Biotechnology,Biotech and Pharmaceuticals,Pharmaceuticals,Health care industry,Breaking News: Business,Politics,business news"}, "category": "Health and Science"}

Still, it could elevate production costs and drug prices, raising affordability concerns, GlobalData said.  Here's a list of the companies that have announced new U.S. investments since Trump took office:  Other companies, such as  , also announced U.S. investments last year.  Meanwhile, Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla on Tuesday said uncertainty around pharmaceutical tariffs is deterring the company from further investing in U.S. manufacturing and research and development.  \"If I know that there will not be tariffs ... then there are tremendous investments that can happen in this country, both in R&D and manufacturing,\" Bourla said on the call, adding that the company is also hoping for \"certainty.\" Feel free to send any tips, suggestions, story ideas and data to Annika at  .  on Tuesday announced that data from its Libre continuous glucose monitoring systems will integrate directly with Epic Systems' electronic health record (EHR) software in the U.S.  A continuous glucose monitor, or a CGM, is a small sensor that pokes through the skin and sends real-time glucose readings to an app. Glucose is a type of sugar people get from food, and it's people's main energy source. Managing glucose is crucial for patients with diabetes to   serious health problems, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  Abbott's integration with Epic will allow doctors to view their patients' glucose data before, during and after visits, and it's meant to help them access the information in a simple and actionable way. Abbott is working with Epic's Aura software, which connects health systems with medical device manufacturers and diagnostics labs, according to a release.  Abbott said there's more to come.  \"While the integration with Libre data is Abbott's first medical device offering with Epic, it's just the beginning,\" Lisa Earnhardt, executive vice president of medical devices for Abbott, said in a release. \"We aim to expand this model to our other medical devices and connected care platforms in the future.\" Abbott sells a range of CGM systems, and it's the market leader in the space based on number of users, according to a 2024 market model from the firm William Blair.  Dexcom, a competing CGM company, is the second largest player behind Abbott, according to William Blair.

The company now expects full-year adjusted earnings of $6 to $6.20 per share, up from a previous guidance of $5.75 to $6 per share But the company revised its GAAP diluted EPS guidance to be lower, which includes charges related to a legal battle involving its pharmacy services provider subsidiary, Omnicare. A jury this week found Omnicare liable for dispensing drugs without valid prescriptions to elderly and disabled individuals in assisted living and long-term care facilities. CVS plans to appeal. The company did not provide a revenue forecast for the year. CVS said it is \"maintaining a cautious view for the remainder of the year\" in light of continued higher medical costs and \"the potential for macro headwinds.\" \"We got smarter about the markets that we wanted and the lives that we wanted to compete for, and so we actually have planned and budgeted for the elevated trends,\" CVS CEO David Joyner said in an interview with CNBC, referring to markets that the insurance unit operates in and higher medical costs \"So I think why you're not seeing a surprise on our part is because we actually plan for elevated trends going into this year,\" he added. Joyner said the company is watching for the potential impact from President  s planned tariffs on pharmaceuticals imported into the U.S. \"On the pharmacy side, I think it is highly dependent on what happens in the next week or two when they announce the implications of tariffs on the manufacturers,\" he told CNBC. Joyner added that the vast majority of the company's retail products at the front of stores are sourced in the U.S., \"which should be a benefit for us.\" Here's what CVS reported for the first quarter compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:  The company's insurer, Aetna, and its rivals have been dogged by higher-than-expected medical costs over the last year as more Medicare Advantage patients return to hospitals for procedures they delayed during the pandemic. But for the first time in several quarters, CVS' insurance business appeared to show some signs of improvement. The unit's medical benefit ratio — a measure of total medical expenses paid relative to premiums collected — decreased to 87.3% from 90.4% a year earlier. A lower ratio typically indicates that a company collected more in premiums than it paid out in benefits, resulting in higher profitability. CVS said the move partly reflects stronger underlying performance in its Medicare business and improved Medicare Advantage star ratings for the 2025 payment year. Those ratings help patients compare the quality of Medicare health and drug plans. \"I think that investment and talent that allowed us to focus on both the execution and the operation … actually helped establish the performance that you're seeing,\" Joyner said, referring to an executive reshuffling last year that tapped a new leader for the insurance unit and other parts of the business. The results cap off the second full quarter with  , a longtime CVS executive, as chief executive of the retail drugstore chain. Joyner succeeded Karen Lynch in mid-October, as CVS struggled to drive higher profits and improve its stock performance. The company underwent a management reshuffle as part of a broader turnaround plan that includes   in cost cuts over the next several years. Still, CVS' performance was partially offset by a charge of $431 million from so-called premium deficiency reserves in the insurance unit, which is related to anticipated losses in the 2025 coverage year. That refers to a liability that an insurer may need to cover if future premiums are not enough to pay for anticipated claims and expenses. The company posted net income of $1.78 billion, or $1.41 per share, for the first quarter. That compares with net income of $1.12 billion, or 88 cents per share, for the year-earlier period.  Excluding certain items, such as amortization of intangible assets, restructuring charges and capital losses, adjusted earnings were $2.25 per share for the quarter. CVS booked sales of $94.59 billion for the first quarter, up 7% from the same period a year ago due to growth across all three of its business segments.  But sales in the company's retail pharmacy segment missed Wall Street's expectations for the quarter, according to StreetAccount. That business has been pressured by softer consumer spending and lower reimbursements for prescription drugs.  CVS' insurance business booked $34.81 billion in revenue during the quarter, up 8% from the first quarter of 2024. Analysts expected the unit to take in $33.51 billion for the period, according to estimates from StreetAccount. The unit also recorded adjusted operating income of $1.99 billion for the first quarter, compared with $732 million for the year-earlier period.  Also on Thursday, CVS said Aetna will stop offering health insurance plans on the Affordable Care Act marketplaces — also known as individual exchanges — starting in the 2026 plan year. CVS' pharmacy and consumer wellness division booked $31.91 billion in sales for the first quarter, up more than 11% from the same period a year earlier. But that was far under the $35.27 billion that analysts were expecting for the quarter, according to StreetAccount. That unit dispenses prescriptions in CVS' more than 9,000 retail pharmacies and provides other pharmacy services, such as vaccinations and diagnostic testing. CVS' health services segment generated $43.46 billion in revenue for the quarter, up nearly 8% compared with the same quarter in 2024. Analysts expected the unit to post $43.64 billion in sales for the period, according to StreetAccount. That unit includes Caremark, one of the nation's largest pharmacy benefit managers.

The move is part of a new partnership between Caremark and Wegovy's manufacturer,  , according to CVS'   release. Caremark will also drop the weight loss drug Zepbound from its standard formularies on that date, in a blow to its manufacturer,  , a CVS spokesperson told CNBC. They said those standard formularies are the most common among Caremark's client base, representing tens of millions of patients. Eligible patients covered by Caremark who are currently taking Zepbound will be able to switch to Wegovy, the spokesperson said. Shares of Novo Nordisk closed around 1% lower on Thursday, while Eli Lilly's stock closed more than 11% lower.  It comes as Novo Nordisk works to boost access to Wegovy now that it is no longer in   in the U.S. Partnering with Caremark, one of the nation's largest pharmacy benefit managers, could help the drugmaker reach even more patients. Caremark discounts drugs with manufacturers on behalf of insurance plans and creates lists of medications, or formularies, that are covered by insurance and reimburses pharmacies for prescriptions. Caremark will make the drug available to its members at \"a more affordable price.\" The PBM negotiated a lower net price for Wegovy over Zepbound on its standard formularies, offering savings to clients that opt into those plans, the CVS spokesperson said. But Caremark's clients, which are employers and unions, \"individually determine how much of that savings on Wegovy gets shared with its members either via lower premiums or lower copays at the pharmacy counter,\" the spokesperson said.  Separately, any patient who does not have insurance coverage for Wegovy or another GLP-1 can still buy Novo Nordisk's drug out-of-pocket for $499 at any of CVS' 9,000 pharmacies nationwide, the spokesperson added.  In its earnings release, CVS said it is the first retail pharmacy partnering with Novo Nordisk's new direct-to-consumer online pharmacy,  , to dispense Wegovy to patients with prescriptions. NovoCare offers Wegovy at that lower price point to cash-paying patients, who may struggle to shoulder the drug's roughly $1,000 list price before insurance and other rebates. Caremark will also combine Wegovy with additional lifestyle support, such as personalized nutrition plans, as part of the CVS Weight Management program. The announcement comes as the Danish drugmaker races to capture more patients now that many compounding pharmacies are legally restricted from making cheaper, unapproved versions of Wegovy, with rare exceptions. \"It's unknown at this point how the migration from the compound pharmacies into other pharmacy settings are going to occur,\" CVS Health group president Prem Shah said on an earnings call on Thursday. \"But we do expect that there will be obviously some benefit by opening up 9,000 stores, or 9,000 opportunities for patients to be able to get the medication.\" Dave Moore, Novo Nordisk's executive vice president of U.S. operations, said in a separate release on Thursday that \"it is our responsibility to continue to work with others across the US healthcare system to find innovative opportunities to meet the needs of these patients and connect them with authentic, FDA-approved Wegovy … in a convenient and affordable way.\"", "summary": null, "related_articles": [], "metadata": {"author": null, "publish_date": "2025-05-01T10:31:30+0000", "read_time": null, "keywords": "Breaking News: Business,Health care industry,Pharmaceuticals,Biotech and Pharmaceuticals,Biotechnology,Business,CVS Health Corp,Novo Nordisk A/S,Novo Nordisk A/S,LILLY DRN,business news"}, "category": "Health and Science"}

The pharmaceutical giant now expects its adjusted fiscal 2025 earnings to come in between $20.78 and $22.28 per share, down from previous guidance of $22.50 to $24 per share. Eli Lilly said the revision reflects a $1.57 billion deal charge recorded in the first quarter, which is primarily related to its acquisition of a certain oral cancer drug from Scorpion Therapeutics. The company maintained its fiscal 2025 sales guidance of $58 billion to $61 billion. Eli Lilly said the guidance reflects President  's existing tariffs as of May 1, but does not include his planned levies on pharmaceuticals imported into the U.S. In an interview with CNBC, Eli Lilly CEO Dave Ricks said the company and other drugmakers are already announcing  , which is one of the Trump administration's stated goals of the tariffs. \"I think that actually the threat of tariffs is already bringing back critical supply chains into important industries, chips and pharma,\" Ricks said. \"So do we need to enact [tariffs?] I'm not so sure.\" He added that Eli Lilly wants to see permanently lower tax rates in the U.S., particularly 15% for domestic production. Ricks said lower taxes drove many drugmakers to manufacture in \"low-tax islands like Ireland Singapore and in Switzerland, and that can come back if there's an economic incentive.\" Eli Lilly's blockbuster diabetes treatment Mounjaro topped expectations for the first quarter, raking in $3.84 billion in revenue. That's up a whopping 113% from the same period a year ago. The company's weight loss drug Zepbound also beat estimates, booking $2.31 billion in sales for the quarter. That more than quadrupled the $517.4 million that the treatment brought in a year ago, when it had just entered the U.S. market. Analysts expected Mounjaro and Zepbound to generate $3.81 billion and $2.28 billion in sales, respectively, according to estimates from StreetAccount. Shares of Eli Lilly closed more than 11% on Thursday. That came after   on Thursday said its pharmacy benefit manager would make   Wegovy the preferred weight loss medication on its main formularies instead of Zepbound. Here's what Eli Lilly reported for the first quarter compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:  The company posted first-quarter revenue of $12.73 billion, up 45% from the same period a year ago.  Sales in the U.S. jumped 49% to $8.49 billion. Eli Lilly said that was driven by a 57% increase in volume – or the number of prescriptions or units sold – for Zepbound and Mounjaro. That was partially offset by lower realized prices of the drugs, the company said. The pharmaceutical giant booked net income of $2.76 billion, or $3.06 per share, for the first quarter. That compares with net income of $2.24 billion, or $2.48 share, a year earlier.  Excluding one-time items associated with the value of intangible assets and other adjustments, Eli Lilly posted earnings of $3.34 per share for the first quarter. Demand in the U.S. has still far outpaced supply of Zepbound and Mounjaro over the last year. Both so-called incretin treatments mimic certain gut hormones to tamp down a person's appetite and regulate their blood sugar. The popularity of those injectable drugs has forced both Eli Lilly and its rival   to invest billions to ramp up manufacturing capacity for their treatments. The efforts appear to be paying off: The Food and Drug Administration in December   to declare the U.S. shortage of tirzepatide — the active ingredient in Zepbound and Mounjaro — over. That decision effectively bars many   from marketing and selling cheaper, unapproved versions of tirzepatide.", "summary": null, "related_articles": [], "metadata": {"author": null, "publish_date": "2025-05-01T10:59:47+0000", "read_time": null, "keywords": "Breaking News: Business,Health care industry,Pharmaceuticals,Biotech and Pharmaceuticals,Biotechnology,Business,Earnings,LILLY DRN,United States,Donald Trump,Donald J.

He spoke after Eli Lilly  , which did not include estimated effects of the potential pharmaceutical tariffs. He said national security concerns around those medications are \"valid.\" But he added: \"Do I think tariffs are the answer to that? I'm not so sure personally.\" \"We would be happy to talk to this administration or national security people about how we could respond to such a crisis,\" he said. \"We have capacities to bring to bear there, and we're happy to help the country if we're in need.\" Older generic drugs account for about  prescribed in the U.S. Many are critical for hospital care, including antibiotics and vasopressors, or medications that raise blood pressure.  Ricks noted that those essential drugs are \"not easy to make, but they're cheap, and they've been driven out of our country due to cost and other damaging policies.\" However, some health experts previously told CNBC that tariffs on generic drugs, which have far lower profit margins than branded medications, could force some generic drugmakers to leave the U.S. market altogether. That could lead to or exacerbate shortages of certain generic drugs in the U.S., such as sterile injectable drugs commonly used in hospitals. Rick's comments come as drugmakers brace for President  's planned pharmaceutical tariffs, which aim to boost domestic manufacturing. Those tariff threats are already   of U.S. manufacturing investments from the pharmaceutical industry.

References to the insect were abundant at the company's old headquarters in London, where a picture of a cockroach was prominently displayed on the wall. For much of Hinge's 10-year history, the cockroach was the unofficial mascot. Staffers named it Flossy after the viral dance move \"the floss.\" Perez relishes the symbolism. In his determination to build a company that will push through adversity, he's encouraged employees to think of themselves like cockroaches, due to the creature's grimy resilience and noted ability to survive harsh conditions. \"It was the identity of every individual in the company,\" said Joshua Sturm, a vice president at Hinge from 2019 to 2024 and now chief revenue officer at cancer prevention startup Color Health. \"We are all in this together, and no matter what happens, we are going to survive together.\" Perez and his 1,400-person workforce now face the ultimate test of their mettle. Hinge, which moved from London to San Francisco in 2017, is trying to go public at a time of such extreme economic uncertainty and market volatility that several companies, including online lender   and ticket marketplace  , have delayed their long-awaited IPOs. Hinge filed its prospectus  , announcing plans to trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol \"HNGE.\" Three weeks later,   announced a sweeping tariff policy that plunged U.S. markets into turmoil after tariff concerns had already pushed the Nasdaq to its worst quarter since 2022. But Hinge, led by its 39-year-old co-founder and CEO, appears determined to power through the chaos. Hinge declined to comment or make Perez available for an interview.  Going public was already going to be a risky endeavor for Hinge. The IPO market has been   since late 2021, when soaring inflation and rising interest rates pushed investors out of risky assets. Within digital health, it's been almost completely dead. Health-tech companies have struggled to adapt to a more muted growth environment following the Covid pandemic, and many once promising business models haven't panned out as planned. The starkest example is virtual health company  , which has a market cap of just over $1 billion less than five years after buying digital health provider Livongo in a deal that valued the   at $37 billion. Teladoc's BetterHelp mental health unit has been a particularly troublesome business as paying users dropped off in the years following the pandemic. Over time, Hinge's Cockroach Award transitioned from a monthly prize to a quarterly distinction. The company phased it out entirely about a year ago in preparation for its next public-facing chapter, but the survive-at-all-costs mentality persists, according to current employees. Now, staffers are recognized with the \"Movers Awards,\" a nod to the company's focus on movement. \"We have many decades of work ahead,\" Perez wrote in a letter to investors in March. \"We hope you join us on this journey.\" CNBC spoke to 13 current and former Hinge employees, investors, and people close to Perez for this story, some of whom asked not to be named in order to provide candid commentary. Hinge uses software to help patients treat acute musculoskeletal injuries, chronic pain and carry out post-surgery rehabilitation remotely. Large employers like   and   cover the costs so their employees can access Hinge's app-based virtual physical therapy, as well as its wearable electrical nerve stimulation device called Enso.  The company   its technology can help users manage pain, cut down health-care costs and reduce the need for surgery and opioids. Revenue increased 33% to $390.4 million last year, while its net loss narrowed to $11.9 million from $108.1 million a year earlier, according to the prospectus. Hinge's roster of clients expanded by 36% last year to 2,256, and the number of individual members jumped 44% to over 532,300, the filing said. In an   on Monday, Hinge   revenue in its first quarter climbed 50% to $123.8 million, up from $82.7 million during the same period last year, and that net income for the period was $17.1 million compared to a loss of $26.5 million a year ago.  Hinge has raised more than $1 billion from investors including Tiger Global Management and Coatue Management, and it boasted a   as of October 2021, the last time the company raised outside funding. The biggest institutional shareholders are venture firms Insight Partners and Atomico, which own 19% and 15% of the stock, respectively, according to the filing. Perez and Gabriel Mecklenburg, Hinge's executive chairman, started the company in 2014. The pair met while they were both pursuing PhDs in the U.K. — Perez at the University of Oxford and Mecklenburg at Imperial College London. They were distracted students, according to Perez's twin brother, David.  By the time they launched Hinge, Perez and Mecklenburg had already co-founded two other ventures together. One was the Oxbridge Biotech Roundtable, an organization that connected academics and industry experts. The other was Marblar, which worked to commercialize academic intellectual property. Perez took a leave of absence from Oxford while working on Marblar and never returned. His brother wasn't a fan of the decision initially. \"I gave him terrible advice,\" said David Perez, a graduate of Yale Law School and partner at Perkins Coie in Seattle. \"I was like, 'I think you're an idiot, I think you should focus on your PhD. Only an idiot would not finish a PhD at Oxford.'\"  The twins have two older siblings. Their mother immigrated from Cuba in 1968, followed 12 years later by their father. Their parents met in Miami, got married after just three dates, and are still together after more than 40 years.  The family moved from Miami to Salt Lake City, Utah, in 1990. Perez's mother was a substitute teacher and his father worked at restaurants as a dishwasher and busboy. David Perez said their father \"worked around the clock\" and used to call out orders in his sleep.  \"It wasn't a lot of money, I think combined they made about $19,000 a year,\" David Perez said. \"But they stitched it together and raised four kids.\"  The twin boys were competitive, particularly when it came to academics and playing basketball in the driveway. David said his brother got \"great grades\" and always had an inclination toward science and medicine, graduating from high school at age 16 and then starting college at Westminster University, a small liberal arts school in Utah. \"I swear,\" David Perez said, \"there were times where the only punishment that my mom could issue that would have the sting was restricting our ability to do homework.\" Perez was a student in the Honors College at Westminster, and he graduated with a degree in biology. Richard Badenhausen, dean of the Honors College, described Perez as an independent thinker and an ambitious student, especially for his age.  \"He didn't care too much what people thought about him, which is a strength in my book,\" Badenhausen said in an interview.  When Perez was 13, he was hit by a car. He broke an arm and a leg, and had to be airlifted to a nearby hospital. After three surgeries and 12 months of rehab, he had a newfound interest in orthopedics and physical therapy.  Mecklenburg had a serious injury of his own, tearing his anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) during a judo match, which also required a year of rehab, according to Hinge's website. One day in October 2014  the pair put their heads together and outlined the tools they wished were available while undergoing physical therapy. Musculoskeletal conditions affect as many as 1.7 billion people worldwide, according to Hinge's prospectus, so there was no shortage of opportunities. They had the early concept of Hinge within hours and a prototype ready by December of that year. In Hinge's early days, Perez and Mecklenburg would meet every Saturday morning to talk shop. Now, as they've aged and started families, they meet on Wednesday nights, according to colleagues. Perez welcomed his first child with his wife late last year.  \"Seeing the growth over the last six, seven, eight years has just been unbelievable,\" said Jon Reynolds, a tech founder who contributed to Hinge's seed funding round. \"That comes down to the quality of Dan and Gabriel as leaders. They complement each other really well, and they've obviously got that mutual respect.\" Perez is a hands-on CEO who expects a lot from his staff.  He's direct, detail-oriented, opinionated, competitive and can be intense, according to current and former employees. But he's committed to the mission and the wellbeing of his employees, they said. \"He's one of those rare founder CEOs who I think can go all the way,\" said Paul Kruszewski, a former Hinge employee who joined the company after it acquired his Canadian computer vision startup, Wrnch, in 2021.  Employees say Perez is a voracious reader, often finishing two to four books a month. That includes books about business and leadership, an important source of information given that Hinge was his first real job. He's a fan of \"The Innovator's Prescription,\" by   and others, \"Crossing the Chasm,\" by Geoffrey Moore and \"The Long Fix,\" by Dr. Vivian Lee. He also likes his staffers to read. Executives will often prepare to discuss chapters from a book in their meetings.  \"I'd come home and there'd be a package from Dan, and it's a book,\" said Sturm, who led partnerships and new market development at Hinge. \"That was just the norm.\" Sturm, who has worked in the health-care and benefits space for around 30 years, said Hinge was very deliberate with hiring, so there wasn't a lot of turnover among senior executives. He said Hinge's recruitment process was the hardest he's ever experienced.  Another \"Dan-ism,\" as Sturm called it, is Hinge's philosophy around writing. Perez has employees write memos, typically up to six pages long, instead of preparing slide decks or other materials ahead of meetings. Perez was inspired by a similar practice at  , according to current and former employees, and sees it as a way to force employees to think through what they want to say instead of hiding behind bullet points. Hinge's memo culture can be an adjustment, particularly for new employees. Sturm said he thought the practice was \"insane\" at first, but ultimately came to appreciate it and said it improved his pitches. \"When you sort of sit back, you go, 'You know actually, he wasn't wrong,'\" Sturm said.  Hinge has come a long way since venture firm Atomico led the $8 million Series A investment in 2017. The London-based firm said in a   at the time that it was \"extremely impressed by Daniel and Gabriel, and their determination to tackle a big problem in society.\" Carolina Brochado led the round, though she left Atomico a year later and now works at investment firm EQT Group. She said that getting Hinge to the brink of an IPO was a \"one in a million chance,\" but noted that the company has managed to build a sizable business in digital health despite having so many odds stacked against it. \"Lots of learnings along the way, of course, like a big tech correction in the middle,\" Brochado said in an interview. \"But it really is one of those rare examples of just an enormous market that was under penetrated.\" For David Perez, whose firm now serves as Hinge's outside counsel, watching the startup grow has been \"fascinating,\" he said. \"I'm a partner at a major law firm,\" he said, \"and I am only the second most successful twin. But I think I'm okay with that.\"  ", "summary": null, "related_articles": [], "metadata": {"author": null, "publish_date": "2025-05-05T12:00:01+0000", "read_time": null, "keywords": "IPO,Teladoc Health Inc,Amazon.com Inc,Breaking News: Technology,Technology,Internet,Health care industry,Venture capital,Target Corp,Morgan Stanley,Donald J.

The company partners with existing imaging facilities across more than 70 locations in the U.S., according to its website.  Full-body MRI scans have surged in popularity in recent years after celebrities like Kim Kardashian began posting about them on social media.

The order directs the Food and Drug Administration to reduce the amount of time it takes to approve manufacturing plants in the U.S. by eliminating unnecessary requirements, streamlining reviews and working with domestic drugmakers to \"provide early support before facilities come online,\" according to  . It also directs the agency to raise inspection fees for foreign manufacturing plants, improve the enforcement of active-ingredient source reporting by overseas producers and consider publicly listing facilities that don't comply. The White House estimates that it can currently take five to 10 years to build new manufacturing capacity for pharmaceuticals, which it called \"unacceptable from a national-security standpoint.\"  \"We don't want to be buying our pharmaceuticals from other countries because if we're in a war, we're in a problem, we want to be able to make our own,\" Trump said in the fact sheet. \"As we invest in the future, we will permanently bring our medical supply chains back home. We will produce our medical supplies, pharmaceuticals, and treatments right here in the United States.\" The order will allow the FDA to conduct more inspections of new manufacturing sites with the same resources, the agency's commissioner, Marty Makary, told reporters on Monday. The FDA will also ramp up inspections of foreign drug facilities, switching from announced to \"surprise\" visits overseas, he said. \"We had this crazy system in the United States where American pharma manufacturers ... are put through the ringer with inspections, and the foreign sites get a lot easier with scheduled visits, while we have surprise visits,\" Makary said. Trump's order also directs the Environmental Protection Agency to \"accelerate the construction of facilities\" related to manufacturing drugs and their ingredients.

Caremark negotiated an undisclosed lower net price for Wegovy over Zepbound on its standard formularies, offering savings on Novo Nordisk's drug to clients that opt into those plans.  But employers and unions will ultimately determine how much of those savings on Wegovy get shared with members, CVS said.  Wegovy's list price before insurance is $1,349 for a month's supply, while Zepbound's is $1,086. That decision by one of the nation's largest PBMs triggered fears of a price war in the weight loss drug market and concerns that Zepbound's sales momentum could stall. Shares of Eli Lilly plunged 11% on Thursday.  But several Wall Street analysts said the selloff was overblown. \"In our view, the Novo/CVS deal does not represent the beginning of an obesity pricing war between Lilly & Novo,\" BMO Capital Markets analyst Evan Seigerman said in a note on Thursday. He added that in discussions with the companies, both Lilly and Novo emphasized they want to expand patient access – not undercut each other on price. That may be reassuring to investors worried that a price war could hurt profit margins. But the high list price of those weight loss drugs may remain a major barrier for many patients, particularly those whose health plans don't cover the medications.  Eli Lilly told the firm it is not interested in exclusive \"one-of-one\" deals with PBMs, while Novo Nordisk said CVS approached the drugmaker about the Wegovy agreement, according to Seigerman. On an earnings call on Thursday, Eli Lilly CEO David Ricks said the company has been trying to move away from setting high list prices and paying bigger rebates to PBMs for preferential coverage. Instead, Eli Lilly is trying to set list prices closer to what it expects the plans to pay for its drugs. \"We have been very vocal about trying to move away from that,\" Ricks said, referring to deep PBM rebates.  He added that Zepbound is still growing market share.  Seigerman agreed, saying that Eli Lilly is \"continuing to perform where it matters.\" Zepbound and the company's diabetes drug Mounjaro now make up over half of U.S. GLP-1 prescriptions, outpacing the combined 46% share of Novo Nordisk's Wegovy and its diabetes treatment Ozempic, according to Seigerman.  That \"market-share traction clearly demonstrates that physicians and patients prefer Zepbound\" over Wegovy, Bernstein analyst Courtney Breen wrote in a separate note on Thursday.  It's unclear how much the CVS formulary change will appeal to employers, especially given that Zepbound is known to be more effective at promoting weight loss than Wegovy. Some patients on the standard formularies may also try to stay on their current Zepbound prescriptions by requesting exemptions, JPMorgan analyst Chris Schott said in a Thursday note.  Eli Lilly's Ricks also said CVS' move mainly affects smaller employers, who are more likely to stick with Caremark's standard formularies. Larger companies covering more patients often use customized formularies, meaning they can still decide to include Zepbound.  Regardless, the CVS-Wegovy deal overshadowed   for Eli Lilly.  The company's first-quarter revenue and earnings topped estimates on skyrocketing demand for Zepbound and Mounjaro, both of which raked in billions of dollars in sales for the period.  We'll continue to track Eli Lilly's performance in the weight loss drug market, so stay tuned!

Health-care marketplace Zocdoc has launched an artificial intelligence phone assistant that can help patients schedule appointments using conversational language. Zocdoc, founded in 2007, helps connect patients to in-network doctors and book appointments for both in person and virtual care. The company's new AI assistant, called Zo, can handle \"unlimited\" inbound calls at any hour of the day, eliminating hold times, Zocdoc said in a release.  The company said Zo can save staffers time and improve patients' experiences, which can ultimately encourage them to seek out the care they need. The assistant also serves as a major step toward what the company called its goal of aiding scheduling \"everywhere patients are seeking care.\" \"What's most exciting about Zo is that it is powered by nearly two decades of Zocdoc's expertise in facilitating patient-provider interactions, understanding complex healthcare scheduling logic, and integrating with a broad base of [electronic health records],\" Zocdoc CEO Oliver Kharraz said in a statement.  Patients can ask Zo questions like, \"Do you take my insurance?,\" or \"Do you have any offices near the West Village?,\" according to a pre-recorded demo. Health-care organizations can implement Zo without any upfront fees, long-term costs or commitments, and they don't have to be Zocdoc Marketplace customers, the company said. Providers can try out the assistant for $2 per booked appointment, but organizations that want to roll it out on a larger scale can access discounted pricing.  Zocdoc said early adopters of Zo have been able to resolve up to 70% of all scheduling calls without staff intervention. The average call lasts around two minutes and 30 seconds.  While appointment management is Zo's first use case, Zocdoc said it's exploring other applications for the assistant, including prescription refills, messaging and outbound calls like appointment reminders or last-minute openings.  Read the full announcement  .  Feel free to send any tips, suggestions, story ideas and data to Ashley at  .", "summary": null, "related_articles": [], "metadata": {"author": null, "publish_date": "2025-05-07T14:24:03+0000", "read_time": null, "keywords": "David A.

The company's BCI will initially be used to help patients with severe paralysis restore functions such as speech and movement, according to its  . Only part of Precision's system was approved by the FDA on Thursday, but it marks the first full regulatory clearance granted to a company developing a wireless BCI, Precision said in  .

Rapoport also helped co-found Musk's Neuralink in 2017 before departing the following year. The piece of Precision's system that the FDA approved is called the Layer 7 Cortical Interface. The microelectrode array is thinner than a human hair and resembles a piece of yellow scotch tape. Each array is made up of 1,024 electrodes that can record, monitor and stimulate electrical activity on the brain's surface. When it is placed on the brain, Precision says it can conform to the surface without damaging any tissue. The FDA authorized Layer 7 to be implanted in patients for up to 30 days, and Precision will be able to market the technology for use in clinical settings. This means surgeons will be able to use the array during procedures to map brain signals, for instance. It is not Precision's end goal for the technology, but it will help the company generate revenue in the near term. Precision has temporarily implanted the Layer 7 in 37 patients so far, and   one case at the Mount Sinai Hospital in New York last April.

He proposed a change that the pharmaceutical industry has long sought. In the wide-ranging order, Trump directed Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to work with Congress to modify a piece of the Medicare drug price negotiation rules, which differentiate between small-molecule drugs and biologic medicines. Currently, the law essentially spares biologics like vaccines from new negotiated prices for 13 years after they receive U.S. approval, compared with just nine years for small-molecule drugs that come in a pill or tablet form. The industry contends that the discrepancy – or what drugmakers call the \"pill penalty\" – discourages companies from investing in the development of small-molecule drugs, which are generally cheaper, easier to manufacture and more convenient for patients to take.  Trump's executive order  , saying the discrepancy \"threatens to distort innovation.\" Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle could be receptive to the proposed change, especially after some   last year that also seeks to eliminate the difference.  It could have huge implications for drugmakers, patients and Medicare's spending on prescription drugs. An   from the health policy research organization KFF said the change would mean small-molecule drugs would be on the market longer before they are eligible for negotiations, which could lead to an increase in Medicare prescription drug spending, higher medication prices and steeper premiums in Medicare Part D plans.  Changing the law \"would come at a cost to Medicare and beneficiaries by giving drug companies 4 additional years of setting their own prices on these drugs prior to being eligible for negotiation by the federal government, unless combined with other changes to prevent higher spending,\" the analysis said.  More than half of the drugs – 13 out of 25 – in the first and second rounds of negotiations would have been ineligible at the time they were selected if the discrepancy between small-molecule treatments and biologics didn't exist, according to KFF. Those 13 drugs accounted for about two-thirds of total gross Medicare Part D spending on the 25 treatments, or $61 billion out of $91 billion, KFF said.  That includes the blood thinner Eliquis from   and  , as well as the Type 2 diabetes treatment Jardiance from Eli Lilly and Boehringer Ingelheim.   would be \"among the biggest beneficiaries\" if the pill penalty is removed, according to a Thursday note from TD Cowen analyst Michael Nedelcovych. At the top of the list of drugs   are the company's blockbuster diabetes injection Ozempic, weight loss shot Wegovy and diabetes pill Rybelsus, which are considered one product for the sake of the negotiations since they all share the same active ingredient, semaglutide. Without the so-called pill penalty, Ozempic, Wegovy and Rybelsus would not be eligible until 2031, which is only one year before patent expiration in the U.S., Nedelcovych said.  Trump's   wasn't all good news for pharma. Analysts pointed out that it contained other proposals that the pharmaceutical industry has strongly opposed.  For example, it calls on the Food and Drug Administration to open up a pathway for more drug imports from Canada, where prescription medications are far cheaper. That was an element of Trump's first-term agenda, and appears to clash with his planned tariffs on pharmaceuticals.  In a note on Tuesday, BMO Capital Markets analyst Evan Seigerman added that \"we're also not out of the woods on tariffs, FDA, or the potential for further drug pricing reform.\" He is referring to the massive overhaul at the FDA and other federal health agencies under Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who now leads the Department of Health and Human Services.  \"While we are encouraged with this [executive order,] we're cautious as to what comes next from the Trump Administration for BioPharma,\" Seigerman said.  We'll be sure to cover any of Trump's other moves, so stay tuned.  Feel free to send any tips, suggestions, story ideas and data to Annika at  .

For readers like this health tech reporter who spend a lot of time thinking, researching and talking about the U.S. health-care system, it can be easy to forget that Epic Systems is not a household name for most Americans.  Many people are familiar with Epic because of its patient portal MyChart, but most of them aren't as aware of the central role its technology plays within the broader health-care industry. Epic's software is used by more than 65,000 clinics and 2,900 hospitals, including the vast majority of major health systems in the U.S.  The company is a health-care technology giant, but it's notoriously private, and that's largely by design. Epic has no marketing department and it doesn't advertise, according to its CEO and founder Judy Faulkner. It never has.  To give you a sense of how the company feels about marketing, Epic declared it would replace all of its developers with marketing staff as an   year. \"During its 43-year history of creating award-winning healthcare software, Epic has prided itself on having a staff that's heavily focused on research and development and not focused on marketing. But times are changing, and Epic needs to keep up,\" the fake announcement reads. Faulkner rarely does media appearances, and for the most part, Epic has largely tried to keep its head down over the years.  In recent weeks, however, the company appears to have started to change its posture. Epic started posting on the social media platform X, coincidentally, on April Fools' Day. The company confirmed the authenticity of the account to CNBC.  Seth Hain, senior vice president of research and development at Epic, participated in a podcast with Julie Yoo, general partner at the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, that was released last week. Andreessen Horowitz is one of the most high-profile firms in Silicon Valley, but Epic has never accepted any investment from venture capitalists. And on Monday, the podcast \"Acquired,\" which tells the stories of companies and their founders, released a four-hour-long episode about Epic. The podcast is the No. 1 Technology show on Apple Podcasts and Spotify and reaches more than 1 million listeners, according to its website. It's hard to know exactly how much Epic assisted with the research for the episode, but the hosts do mention that the company confirmed some facts.  Taken together, these developments suggest that Epic is at least exploring a more public-facing persona.

The Food and Drug Administration is phasing out the use of petroleum-based synthetic dyes by the end of next year, the agency announced on Tuesday. \"For the last 50 years, American children have increasingly been living in a toxic soup of synthetic chemicals,\" FDA Commissioner Marty Makary said at a press conference. Food and beverage companies use additives like red dye 40 to give cereal, chips, sports drinks and other products bright hues that attract shoppers. But backlash against artificial colorants has been brewing in the U.S. for more than a decade. The changes will affect a slew of food giants, including  ,  , Mars and  . The industry has argued that the claims about the dangers of artificial dyes lack evidence that would support any bans. As of Tuesday, the FDA and the food industry don't have a formal agreement to remove artificial dyes but instead \"an understanding,\" according to Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. It is unclear what enforcement actions the agency would take if food and beverage companies do not comply. \"There are a number of tools at our disposal,\" Makary said. \"I believe in love, let's start in a friendly way and see if we can do this without any statutory or regulatory changes, but we are exploring every tool in the toolbox to make sure this gets done very quickly. And they want to do it — so why go down a complicated road with Congress?\" The FDA is taking several actions, including setting a \"national standard\" and timeline for the food industry to transition from petroleum-based food dyes to natural alternatives, according to Makary. The agency is also initiating a process to revoke authorization of synthetic food colorings, including those not in production, within the coming weeks. He added that the FDA is also eliminating the remaining six synthetic dyes on the market from the U.S. food supply by the end of the year, specifically red dye 40, yellow dye 5, yellow dye 6, blue dye 1, blue dye 2 and green dye 2. It is also requesting food companies to phase out red dye 3 by the end of next year, which is sooner than the 2027 to 2028 deadline previously announced, according to Makary. \"For companies that are currently using petroleum based red dye, try watermelon juice or beet juice. For companies currently combining petroleum-based yellow chemical and red dyes together, try carrot juice,\" he said.  Makary added that the agency plans to authorize four additional color additives using natural ingredients in the coming weeks, while also expediting the review and approval of other natural ingredient colors. Makary cited a   that concluded that artificial colors in the diet \"result in increased hyperactivity.\" \"The F in FDA stands for food,\" he said. \"Now, there's no one ingredient that accounts for the child chronic disease epidemic. And let's be honest, taking petroleum-based food dyes out of the food supply is not a silver bullet that will instantly make America's children healthy, but it is one important step.\" Last month, Kennedy   that removing artificial dyes from the food system is an urgent priority of the Trump administration. Meeting attendees included the CEOs of PepsiCo North America, Kraft Heinz, General Mills, Tyson Foods, WK Kellogg, J.M. Smucker and the Consumer Brands Association, the industry's top trade group. Kennedy has used Kellogg's Froot Loops as his primary example when railing against artificial colorants. While it is unclear exactly how removing dyes could affect the companies' businesses, it will be a major effort to overhaul recipes — and the new looks could affect how consumers perceive the products. Makary said phasing out petroleum-based food dyes won't increase food prices, pointing to other countries that have made similar moves. However, synthetic dyes are generally more cost-effective than natural alternatives, which often require larger quantities to achieve vibrant colors and can carry higher production costs, according to some  and  . Previously, pushback from consumer advocates led some of the companies to tweak their formulas and drop artificial dyes without any government intervention.

The naturally dyed cereal, which used turmeric, radishes and purple carrots, was not as vibrant, and customers rejected the new version. Kennedy is   that oversees food and tobacco products,   and other medicines, scientific research, public health infrastructure and government-funded health care. After just two months on the job, he has drastically changed the nation's federal health agencies.  In March, he announced  to slash 10,000 full-time employees across different departments and consolidate divisions. He has cut back crucial parts of HHS, including offices that handle HIV prevention efforts and work to  . The Food and Drug Administration is also   for testing fluid milk and other dairy products due to reduced capacity in its food safety and nutrition division, Reuters reported on Tuesday. Kennedy's so-called Make America Healthy Again platform argues a corrupt alliance of drug and food companies and the federal health agencies that regulate them are making Americans less healthy. He has pledged to end the chronic disease epidemic in children and adults, and has been vocal about  , rather than drugs, central to that goal. In January, before President Donald Trump or Kennedy took office, the Food and Drug Administration   of one type of red food dye called Red No. 3. The dye is known to cause cancer in laboratory animals, but food manufacturers were allowed to use it for years because scientists didn't believe it raised the risk of cancer in humans at the level it is typically consumed. At least one company is benefitting from the ban on artificial dyes:  , which helps companies tweak their flavors and formulas. \"Now, reformulation activity has always been a part of the work that we do with our customer base, and we've been doing that for quite some time, but we are seeing a tick up in reformulation activity,\" McCormick CEO Brendan Foley told analysts on the company's earnings call in late March, adding that companies are seeking help cutting both artificial colors and sodium from their products.", "summary": null, "related_articles": [], "metadata": {"author": null, "publish_date": "2025-04-22T20:22:17+0000", "read_time": null, "keywords": "Restaurants,Food and drink,Business,Biotechnology,Biotech and Pharmaceuticals,Pharmaceuticals,Health care industry,Breaking News: Business,Social issues,PepsiCo Inc.,Donald Trump,Kraft Heinz Co,General Mills Inc,Tyson Foods Inc,WK Kellogg Co,McCormick & Company Inc,Robert F.

In lawsuits filed Wednesday, Lilly accuses the sites — Mochi Health, Fella Health, Willow Health and Henry Meds — of deceiving consumers about \"untested, unapproved drugs\" and turning them away from Lilly's medicines. Lilly alleges the companies are claiming to offer personalized options when they are actually mass-marketing slightly different versions of Lilly's drugs in order to skirt FDA rules. Lilly also claims some of the sites are selling formulations of the drugs that haven't been studied, such as oral tablets and drops. Fella, Willow and Henry Meds didn't immediately respond to CNBC's requests for comment. Mochi Health in a statement said its model \"remains compliant with FDA guidance and pharmacy regulations.\"  Lilly's diabetes drug Mounjaro went into short supply in late 2022, allowing pharmacies and outsourcing facilities to produce the treatment, a practice called compounding. Novo Nordisk's weight loss drug Wegovy was also in short supply, opening up the market for compounding GLP-1s. That business boomed online, where people sought versions of the treatments if they couldn't find the brand names or couldn't get them covered by insurance. Mass compounding of tirzepatide, the active ingredient in Mounjaro and Zepbound, was supposed to stop last month after the Food and Drug Administration declared the shortage of the drugs over. Some pharmacies kept doing it anyway, producing versions that differ slightly from the brand name, which could possibly keep them out of the FDA's crosshairs. Earlier this month, Lilly   two pharmacies, alleging they falsely marketed their products as personalized versions of the drugs that have been clinically tested and are made using stringent safety standards. One of the telehealth platforms Lilly is now suing, Mochi Health, planned to continue selling compounded versions of tirzepatide, betting that offering personalized treatments would keep it out of legal trouble, Mochi CEO Myra Ahmad   in March. Asked whether she feared legal action from Lilly, Ahmad said she wasn't worried about her prescribers since \"they have established patient-physician relationships\" and \"the beauty of medicine is really that they get full autonomy to decide what is the best way to manage their patients.\" Lilly in its filing Wednesday claimed Ahmad is not a licensed physician and that Mochi and its \"unlicensed owners exercise undue influence and control over, among other things, the prescribing decisions of physicians\" and as a result engage in the \"unlawful corporate practice of medicine.\" Ahmad in a statement said the use of compounded medications \"remains appropriate and legal when tailored to individual patient needs and prescribed by a licensed medical provider\" and that Mochi's physicians choose which treatments are best for their patients. She said she holds a doctor of medicine degree but is not practicing as CEO of Mochi. Lilly makes a similar allegation against Fella Health, accusing the company of making \"sweeping corporate decisions that dictate patient care, such as when Fella changed patients en masse from one tirzepatide formulation to another with additives.\" In all four cases, Lilly is seeking to stop the sites from marketing or selling tirzepatide.

Merck has built a robust presence in China, which is considered one of the company's most important markets and is home to some of its partners and manufacturing and research and development sites.  Merck noted that the new outlook does not account for President  's planned tariffs on pharmaceuticals imported into the U.S., which are prompting some drugmakers to   footprints.  That includes Merck, which has invested $12 billion in U.S. manufacturing and research and development and expects to put more than $9 billion more into the country by the end of 2028. On an earnings call on Thursday, Merck CEO Rob Davis said that \"as you look at 2025, we're well positioned with inventory to be able to mitigate anything we could see in the short term.\" He added that in the medium to long term, \"we've already started to identify where we can either reposition our own manufacturing,\" which could look like changing the priorities of existing plants, or bring on external manufacturing to \"bridge gaps\" and build internal production further. \"In many ways, we are aligned with what the administration is wanting to do, and feel that we're in position to be able to do that quite effectively,\" he said. The new guidance does include a one-time charge of roughly 6 cents per share related to the company's license agreement with Hengrui Pharma, which it   in March. Merck reiterated its full-year sales forecast of between $64.1 billion and $65.6 billion.  Also on Thursday, the drugmaker reported first-quarter revenue and profit that beat expectations, as it said it saw strength in its oncology portfolio and animal health products.  Merck also cited \"increasingly meaningful\" sales contributions from two recently launched drugs. They are Winrevair, which is used to treat a rare, deadly lung condition, and Capvaxive, a vaccine designed to protect adults from a bacteria known as pneumococcus that can cause serious illnesses and lung infection.  Sales of those drugs will likely be critical to Merck's efforts to offset losses from its top-selling cancer therapy Keytruda, which will lose exclusivity in 2028.  Here's what Merck reported for the first quarter compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:  The company posted net income of $5.08 billion, or $2.01 per share, for the quarter. That compares with net income of $4.76 billion, or $1.87 per share, during the year-earlier period.  Excluding acquisition and restructuring costs, Merck earned $2.22 per share for the first quarter.  Merck raked in $15.53 billion in revenue for the quarter, down 2% from the same period a year ago. Merck's pharmaceutical unit, which develops a wide range of drugs, booked $13.64 billion in revenue during the first quarter. That's down 3% from the same period a year ago. Keytruda recorded $7.21 billion in revenue during the quarter, up just 4% from the year-earlier period.  That increase was driven by higher uptake of Keytruda for earlier-stage cancers and strong demand for the drug for metastatic cancers, which spread to other parts of the body. Still, sales came under the $7.43 billion that analysts had expected, according to StreetAccount estimates.   Notably, Merck continued to see   of Gardasil, a vaccine that prevents cancer from HPV, the most common sexually transmitted infection in the U.S.  In February, Merck announced a decision to halt shipments of Gardasil into China beginning that month and going through at least mid-2025. Investors will likely be looking for updates on that effort during the earnings call on Thursday.  The Chinese market makes up the majority of the blockbuster shot's international revenue. Merck is hoping that Gardasil's expanded approval for men ages 9 to 26 in China will help boost uptake of the vaccine. Gardasil raked in $1.33 billion in sales, down 41% from the first quarter of 2024 primarily due to lower demand in China. That's below the $1.45 billion that analysts were expecting, according to StreetAccount estimates.  China has retaliated with tariffs of 125% on goods from the U.S. Some experts said China's tariffs on U.S. products could lead to increased prices or limited supply of some popular Western medicines for Chinese patients, Reuters  . Merck's animal health division, which develops vaccines and medicines for dogs, cats and cattle, posted nearly $1.59 billion in sales, up 5% from the same period a year ago. The company said higher demand for livestock products and sales from Elanco's aqua business, which it acquired last year, drove that growth.", "summary": null, "related_articles": [], "metadata": {"author": null, "publish_date": "2025-04-24T10:32:03+0000", "read_time": null, "keywords": "United States,China,Merck & Co Inc,Breaking News: Business,Health care industry,Pharmaceuticals,Biotech and Pharmaceuticals,Biotechnology,Business,Earnings,Donald Trump,Donald J.

The company now expects 2025 revenue to come in between $45.8 billion and $46.8 billion, up from a   of around $45.5 billion. Bristol Myers also projects full-year adjusted earnings of $6.70 to $7 per share, which compares with its prior forecast of $6.55 to $6.85 per share.  Notably, the company said its guidance revisions include the estimated impact of current tariffs on U.S. products shipped to China. China is a critical market for Bristol Myers. The company has   its \"China 2030 Strategy,\" which is a   to bring more of its medicines to the nation to address unmet medical needs in areas like gastric cancer and include more Chinese patients in clinical trials. But the new outlooks do not account for any of President  s planned tariffs on pharmaceuticals imported into the U.S., Bristol Myers said.  In an earnings call Thursday, Bristol Myers Squibb CEO Christopher Boerner said the company appreciated the Trump administration's efforts to increase U.S. manufacturing, but noted that it \"needs to be done in a very thoughtful and deliberate way\" in the pharmaceutical sector. He added that it is \"simply too early to provide a lot more\" on the company's expectations for pharmaceutical-specific tariffs. Still, Bristol Myers is continuing \"mitigation efforts\" to reduce risks of any disruption to the supply chain and shortages, Boerner said. \"We have a tremendous amount of flexibility to be able to move our manufacturing around should any potential tariffs come up,\" said the company's CFO David Elkins on the call. He added that Bristol Myers has a broad global manufacturing network, which includes a significant presence in the U.S. Bristol Myers said the outlook hike reflects strength in its portfolio of newer drug brands, and better-than-anticipated first-quarter sales from its legacy portfolio of older medications.  The results come as Bristol Myers moves to slash $2 billion in expenses by the end of 2027, which is on top of $1.5 billion in planned cost cuts by the end of this year.  It also comes just days after Bristol Myers' recently approved schizophrenia drug, Cobenfy,  , leading some Wall Street analysts to substantially lower their multibillion-dollar sales forecasts for the treatment.   The company is banking on Cobenfy and other so-called growth portfolio drugs to offset the loss in revenue from top-selling treatments slated to lose exclusivity on the market, including its blockbuster blood thinner Eliquis and cancer immunotherapy Opdivo.  Boerner said \"there's a lot of uncertainty, whether related to tariffs, a potential economic downturn or restructuring at the FDA and HHS.\" He is referring to the Trump administration's efforts to   the Food and Drug Administration and other federal health agencies under the Department of Health and Human Services. But the company remains confident in its ability \"to deliver for our patients, employees and shareholders,\" he said. Here is what Bristol Myers reported for the first quarter compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:  Bristol Myers posted net income of $2.5 billion, or $1.20 per share, for the first quarter. That compares with a net loss of $11.9 billion, or a loss of $5.89 per share, for the year-earlier period.  Excluding certain items, it reported adjusted earnings per share of $1.80 for the quarter.  The pharmaceutical giant's revenue fell 6% from the same period a year ago to $11.2 billion.  Eliquis booked $3.57 billion in sales for the quarter, down 4% from the year-ago period. That is above the $3.34 billion that analysts were expecting, according to estimates compiled by StreetAccount. The blood thinner, which Bristol Myers shares with  , is expected to lose market exclusivity by 2028.  Sales of Eliquis could also take a hit in 2026, when a   for the drug goes into effect for certain Medicare patients following negotiations with the federal government. Those price talks are a key provision of the Inflation Reduction Act. The   targets 15 additional drugs and will set new prices that will go into effect in 2028. That includes the Bristol Myers medication Pomalyst, which is used to treat a blood cancer called multiple myeloma and a different cancer that develops in people with HIV. Pomalyst brought in $658 million for the period, down 24% from a year earlier. Revlimid, a drug used to treat adults with multiple myeloma, took in $936 million in sales for the first quarter, down 44% from the same period a year ago.   Revenue from the company's so-called growth portfolio was $5.56 billion for the first quarter, up 16% from the year-earlier period.  Opdivo brought in $2.27 billion in revenue for the first quarter, rising 9% from the year-earlier period. That is above analysts' estimate of $2.16 billion for the quarter, StreetAccount said.

That came in response to a February lawsuit from a compounding trade group against the Food and Drug Administration's determination that the active ingredient in those drugs, semaglutide, is no longer in shortage in the U.S. Patients flocked to the cheaper copycats when Ozempic and Wegovy were in short supply over the last two years due to skyrocketing demand, or if they didn't have insurance coverage for the costly treatments.  During  , pharmacists can legally make compounded versions of brand-name medications. Many telehealth companies, such as  , also offered those copycats. But drugmakers and some health experts have pushed back against the practice because the FDA does not approve compounded drugs, which are essentially custom-made copies prescribed by a doctor to meet a specific patient's needs.  \"We are pleased the court has rejected the compounders' attempts to undermine FDA's data-based decision that the shortage\" of semaglutide is resolved, said Steve Benz, Novo Nordisk's corporate vice president, legal and U.S. general counsel, in a statement.  \"Patient safety remains a top priority for Novo Nordisk and the extensive nationwide legal actions we have taken to protect Americans from the health risks posed by illegitimate 'semaglutide' drugs are working,\" he said, referring to the company's more than 100 lawsuits against compounding pharmacies and other entities across 32 states.  On Thursday, U.S. District Judge Mark Pittman specifically denied the Outsourcing Facilities Association's bid for a preliminary injunction that would have prevented the FDA from taking action against its members for making copies of semaglutide.  That decision upholds the FDA's previous determination that the semaglutide shortage in the U.S. is over and means the FDA can now immediately go after so-called 503A pharmacies that are making compounded versions of semaglutide according to individual prescriptions for a specific patient. Those pharmacies are largely regulated by states rather than the FDA. The decision also means the FDA can start targeting federally regulated 503B pharmacies, which manufacture compounded drugs in bulk with or without prescriptions, after May 22. The agency's actions can include product seizures and warning letters to pharmacies.  The decision on Thursday follows another win for Novo Nordisk. A different federal judge in Texas earlier this week ruled in favor of the drugmaker against a 503A pharmacy, MediOak Pharmacy, permanently prohibiting the business from marketing or selling compounded semaglutide.

Eli Lilly has gone through a   with tirzepatide, the active ingredient in its weight loss drug Zepbound and diabetes treatment Mounjaro. The FDA declared the U.S. shortage of tirzepatide over last year, prompting the same compounding trade group to sue the FDA over the drug.  In March, a federal judge denied the compounding group's request for a preliminary injunction on the FDA's enforcement against its members for making copies of Mounjaro and Zepbound.

The company previously said its cost-cutting program would deliver overall net cost savings of roughly $4.5 billion by the end of 2025. On Tuesday, Pfizer said it now expects additional savings of roughly $1.2 billion, primarily in selling, informational and administrative expenses, by the end of 2027.  The company said that will be driven in large part by \"enhanced digital enablement,\" including automation and artificial intelligence and streamlining business processes. The expanded cuts also include expected research and development reorganization cost savings of around $500 million by the end of 2026, the company added. Those savings will be reinvested into Pfizer's product pipeline.  Pfizer has a  to slash costs, with the first phase of the effort slated to deliver $1.5 billion in savings by the end of 2027. With the added cuts announced Tuesday, Pfizer now expects to deliver around $7.7 billion in savings by the end of that year from the two cost-cutting efforts. The cuts aim to help the pharmaceutical giant recover from the rapid decline of its Covid business and stock price over the last few years, and appear to be paying off. Here's what the company reported for the   compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:  The results come as drugmakers brace for President  's planned tariffs on pharmaceuticals imported into the U.S. – his administration's bid to boost U.S. manufacturing of medications.  Unlike other companies grappling with evolving trade policy, Pfizer did not revise its outlook. The company maintained its full-year 2025 outlook, forecasting sales of $61 billion to $64 billion, with a similar performance from its Covid products as seen in 2024, however Pfizer noted in its earnings release that the guidance \"does not currently include any potential impact related to future tariffs and trade policy changes, which we are unable to predict at this time.\" But on the earnings call on Tuesday, Pfizer executives said the guidance does reflect $150 million in costs from Trump's existing tariffs. \"Included in our guidance that we didn't really speak about is there are some tariffs in place today,\" Pfizer CFO Dave Denton said on the call. \"We are contemplating that within our guidance range and we continue to again trend to the top end of our guidance range even with those costs to be incurred this year,\" he said. On the call, Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla said the company established a team to analyze a range of potential outcomes and develop strategies to help mitigate the potential impact of tariffs on its business in the short and long term. That team is managing current inventory levels in certain jurisdictions and leveraging Pfizer's domestic manufacturing footprint, among other efforts. \"Should we be impacted by further tariffs in the future, we will assess the impact of the policies enacted and provide information at the appropriate time,\" Bourla said. He added that uncertainty around Trump's pharmaceutical tariffs is deterring the company from further investing in U.S. manufacturing and research and development. Pfizer still expects that   resulting from the Inflation Reduction Act will hurt sales by $1 billion, dampening growth by approximately 1.6% compared with 2024. Stripping out one-time items, the company expects 2025 earnings to be in the range of $2.80 to $3 a share.  \"With the underlying strength of our business, we believe we can be agile in navigating an uncertain and volatile external environment,\" Bourla said in a release. For the first quarter, the company booked net income of $2.97 billion, or 52 cents per share. That compares with net income of $3.12 billion, or 55 cents per share, during the same period a year ago.  Excluding certain items, including restructuring charges and costs associated with intangible assets, the company posted earnings per share of 92 cents for the quarter. Pfizer reported revenue of $13.72 billion for the first quarter, down 8% from the same period a year ago. The company said the decrease in sales was primarily driven by a decline in revenue for Paxlovid, which posted $491 million in sales during the first quarter, down 76% from the same period a year ago, in part due to lower Covid infections worldwide and reduced international government purchases of the drug. The drop in sales also reflects a boost Pfizer got in the first quarter of 2024 from a final adjustment related to a previously recorded revenue reversal for Paxlovid.  Analysts had expected Paxlovid to generate $769.7 million in sales for the first quarter, according to StreetAccount estimates. Meanwhile, the company's Covid shot, Comirnaty, booked $565 million in revenue, up 60% from the same period a year ago. That's above the $352 million that analysts were expecting, according to StreetAccount. The results come as shot makers like Pfizer face uncertainty over immunization policy and regulation under Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a prominent vaccine skeptic who now oversees the nation's federal health agencies. As secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, Kennedy has pursued a sweeping overhaul of different agencies, cutting staff, consolidating or eliminating offices and taking actions that could ultimately undermine vaccines.", "summary": null, "related_articles": [], "metadata": {"author": null, "publish_date": "2025-04-29T10:59:28+0000", "read_time": null, "keywords": "Breaking News: Earnings,Earnings,Pfizer Inc,Business,Biotechnology,Biotech and Pharmaceuticals,Pharmaceuticals,Health care industry,Breaking News: Business,Dividends,United States,Albert Bourla,Donald J.

The Danish drugmaker is racing to capture more patients now that many compounding pharmacies are legally restricted from making cheaper, unapproved versions of  , with rare exceptions. Patients flocked to those compounded versions while Wegovy was in shortage due to skyrocketing demand.  \"We felt it was really important to work hard to establish a collaboration with telehealth companies so that there could be access to Wegovy as the compounding is winding down,\" Dave Moore, executive vice president of U.S. operations at Novo Nordisk, told CNBC.  \"We're really pleased about the level of interest to access branded Wegovy and to start to sort of catch people as they come off of compounded medicine,\" he said.  Moore added that the new partnerships make the experience \"seamless\" for patients since it allows them to access Wegovy straight from their telehealth providers, which \"makes it very easy\" for them to get the drug shipped directly to their homes.  Patients will be able to access Novo Nordisk's new direct-to-consumer online pharmacy,  , directly through the   providers.  That pharmacy offers Wegovy for $499 in cash per month – roughly half its usual monthly list price  – for patients without insurance coverage for the weekly injection.  Each telehealth company's price may be higher because they likely include additional services, a Novo Nordisk spokesperson told CNBC.  Hims & Hers said it will begin offering all dose sizes of Wegovy along with access to 24/7 care, nutritional guidance and ongoing clinical support this week, starting at $599 per month to eligible cash-paying patients with a prescription.  The medication will cost Hims & Hers customers more since it comes with added access to care, the company's CEO, Andrew Dudum, told CNBC in an interview. He said he thinks the company's partnership with Novo Nordisk will serve as a case study for how patients get access to and get prices for \"great medicine\" and other forms of treatment.  Ro opted for the lower price, announcing Tuesday it will offer access to all doses of Wegovy for $499 per month. The company provides 24/7 messaging, one-on-one coaching, educational content and more through its monthly membership called the Body Program, which does not include the cost of medication. \"Adding Novo Nordisk's FDA-approved treatments at the best available cash price will help more patients nationwide get the obesity care they need to achieve their goals, particularly those without insurance coverage,\" Ro CEO Zach Reitano said in a release. Earlier this month, Hims & Hers   that patients could access  's weight loss medication   and diabetes drug  , as well as the generic injection liraglutide, through its platform. But unlike the company's collaboration with Novo Nordisk,   released a statement clarifying that it has \"no affiliation\" with Hims & Hers. Hims & Hers started prescribing compounded semaglutide, the active ingredient in  's diabetes drug Ozempic and Wegovy, in May of 2024. The company has largely had to stop offering the compounded medications en masse, but some consumers may still be able to access personalized doses if it's clinically applicable, Dudum said.  \"That was one of the first things we shared with Novo is that we will always fight on behalf of what consumers we believe have the right to get,\" Dudum said. \"The regulation is very clear.\"  During  , pharmacists can legally make compounded versions of brand-name medications. They can also be produced on a case-by-case basis when it's medically necessary for a patient, such as when they can't swallow a pill or are allergic to a specific ingredient in a branded drug.  But drugmakers and some health experts have pushed back against the practice, largely because the FDA does not approve compounded drugs.  Larger, federally regulated compounding pharmacies that make copies of semaglutide in bulk without prescriptions face a legal deadline of May 22 to stop marketing and selling those versions. Smaller, state-licensed compounding pharmacies that manufacture semaglutide copycats for individual prescriptions had a deadline of April 22.   \"The spirit of this is that we stay true to what the rules are,\" Moore said. \"That's the best way for us to serve patients.\"", "summary": null, "related_articles": [], "metadata": {"author": null, "publish_date": "2025-04-29T11:52:16+0000", "read_time": null, "keywords": "Breaking News: Business,Health care industry,Pharmaceuticals,Biotech and Pharmaceuticals,Biotechnology,Business,Novo Nordisk A/S,Hims & Hers Health Inc,Novo Nordisk A/S,business news"}, "category": "Health and Science"}

For Chelsea Hirschhorn, having her first child led her to become \"totally disillusioned\" with the chasm between the image of new parenthood that was marketed and the reality she experienced. \"The picture-perfect image of parenting was overwhelming for a new parent,\" she said. \"There was a big dichotomy between the content I was consuming and the front-line experience at 3 a.m.\" Hirschhorn says there was no data available at the time to substantiate what she felt because the topic was understudied and underfunded, so she \"took on\" the category of infant health and wellness. \"For whatever reason,\" Hirschhorn says, she had \"the conviction to think I could fix this.\" While there is a distinction between the health challenges the two female CEO and founders focus on — not every woman will become pregnant but all will go through menopause — one big idea binds the two women leaders together: products, treatments and services exist that can meet critical needs in an underserved, and undervalued, market. \"We have this idea that perimenopause is at a certain time and people think they have to suffer for a really long time before they get the right care, but what we say is you don't have to suffer at all,\" Strober shared at the Changemakers Summit. \"As soon as you're in your 30s and anything starts feeling wrong, you should get help. The idea of suffering is really outdated,\" she said. \"Women have been trained to suffer for far too long.\"  and   were both named to the  . (Actress and entrepreneur  , who has become a leading advocate for menopause health as founder and chief creative officer at Stripes Beauty after struggling with early menopause at the height of her early Hollywood fame, was also among the 2025 Changemakers.) At the Changemakers Summit on April 8, the two women CEOs shared advice and lessons from their successes bringing new business ideas to health care. Here are a few of the key themes they touched on in a discussion with CNBC's Kate Rooney. In addition to \"the dearth of information\" that exists to prepare women for the reality of parenthood, educational content for women has been censored when on topics related to reproductive health. That was something that Hirschhorn learned once she started Frida, a time when it was \"almost impossible,\" she says, to find authentic storytelling on the subject matter, and led her to create  . \"Sixty percent of women's health ads content, or content in general, has been in some way, shape or form, rejected or filtered,\" she said. That's not just online but on linear television, part of what Hirschhorn calls a \"very gendered dichotomy,\" citing the fact that male health and sexual wellness content is approved at a significantly higher rate. That leaves her \"incredulous,\" she said, and it is a call to action to shift from women's health being a topic of provocation to a topic of public health. \"Women have to advocate for themselves,\" she said. \"Women can't be complacent, and this goes beyond health care. This can drive real change, in retail ... in every facet of life,\" she added. Strober noted that when she was building Midi Health it became clear that a major challenge would be working with codes created by the insurance industry for menopause, in effect, another form of institutional censorship. Midi Health decided to position itself as an in-network primary care provider that had a specialty in menopause and that turned out to be a \"really effective\" way to gain traction, she says, and it now has nationwide insurance coverage with all the large insurance companies in the U.S. \"They are not necessarily going to cover sexual health issues but they will cover primary care, so you just subsume it,\" she explained. By viewing menopause as just part of women's health, she says, the company was able to create a reimbursement mechanism that meets insurance standards. That insurance coverage is a very big deal, because research is showing that lack of menopause treatment can have a high cost when it comes to women's careers.   Strober pointed to during the Changemakers discussion found that at the mid-career moment when women should be gaining their greatest successes in the workplace, the shift into menopause can hold them back. Strober said the growing body of research details how menopause can result in discrimination at work, with women quitting jobs, or not going for raises or promotions because of symptoms, and also because they don't believe they can get the treatment that they need. \"If you believe that you have something that can't be fixed, it's very embarrassing, and that means people step back from what they are doing,\" Strober said. \"They are scared,\" she added. That can be the experience that is called brain fog, and also hot flashes. \"You lose power during hot flashes,\" Strober said. \"People are not as confident. But if you are getting treated for it, 'it's just a hot flash' and you can regain power,\" she added. Hirschhorn says that by the numbers, there is still huge potential in the women's health market. It is estimated to grow to $60 billion by 2027, according to data she cited at the event, and that is despite the fact that less than 4% of health-care R&D spending and investment goes to the category — a \"seismic gap,\" she said. It is a well-known fact in consumer research that women dominate household spending, but Hirschhorn said in Frida's market there is a \"viral\" opportunity that is underappreciated. \"Creating products for women based on real need creates a virality that is hard to recreate with other demographics,\" she said. \"These women aren't just buying their products, they are selling them to their communities and friends. We call that 'word of mom,\" Hirschhorn said. \"It's a really big untapped opportunity,\" she added. As a former venture investor, Strober said it is important to accept that \"people are not dying to invest in women's health,\" but she added that when you can show the growth that companies like Midi Health are posting, that won't slow a company down. \"We are the fastest-growing digital health company, probably ever, quite honestly,\" she said. \"We are growing insanely fast because women really need access to this care and can't get it elsewhere,\" she added. Similar to the \"virality\" experienced by Frida, Strober says the business model does build on itself. \"Once you take care of one thing for women they come back to you for something else, and if you develop this trusted platform for them, where they become your long-term patient, that is a good business,\" she said. \"We don't say it's a women's business, we say it's a really good business,\" she added. That opportunity and the unfiltered realities of parenthood have now grown Frida to more than 150 products, covering everything from conception to post-partum and breastfeeding care, and beyond. \"My four children are a hotbed of inspiration and my 'snot sucking' days are almost over,\" Hirschhorn said. But she added, \"The same problems exist, you just need a different toolkit.\" At Midi Health, Strober says the next big opportunity to unlock is making connections between menopause health and longevity. \"If you take care of yourself in your 40s you can really prevent a lot of the diseases that come in your 80s, and so we have been thinking a lot about this longevity market,\" Strober said. \"It's all bros, all the bros who are out there and talking about wanting to live to 150. We just want to take care of ourselves. We don't care about living to 150. We just want to be healthy grandmas,\" she said. \"What do we do, how do we take care of our brains and bones and hearts to age in a healthy way?\" Strober asks. She says there are many treatments, products and services yet to be developed by health companies that will help women in their 40s, 50s and 60s to better answer that question.", "summary": null, "related_articles": [], "metadata": {"author": null, "publish_date": "2025-04-29T19:23:50+0000", "read_time": null, "keywords": "Menopause,Health,Gender issues,Health care industry,Health insurance,Suppress Zephr,Social issues,business news"}, "category": "Health and Science"}

For many, the big question is whether the pricey medications known as GLP-1s will pay off by improving worker health and lowering overall health costs over time. Analysts at Aon say it's already happening.   \"We've never seen anything like this, really,\" said Greg Case, CEO of  , an employer benefits services firm. \"There was a 44% reduction in major cardiovascular issues. There was substantial reduction in osteoporosis. There was substantial reduction in pneumonia of multiple types.\" Aon researchers found that within two years, patients taking GLP-1 drugs saw improved health outcomes, which significantly slowed the growth rate of their medical costs. The rate of growth, known as the medical cost trend – was cut roughly in half, the researchers said.     GLP-1s come at a list price of more than $1,000 per dose. As broader approval for the drugs spurs higher demand, it's also causing employer drug spending to spike. Since 2023, GLP-1s have pushed costs up at a faster pace than high-priced specialty medications, which include costly cancer and autoimmune treatments,   by Evernorth, a division of  . Aon analysts looked at medical claims data for 139,000 U.S.-based workers with employer health coverage who took GLP-1 medications between 2022 and 2024. Beyond the drug costs, the study found GLP-1 patients tend to incur higher medical costs in their first year on the drugs, with more doctor visits to monitor their treatment on the drug and to seek help for other issues such as sleep apnea and esophageal conditions like acid reflux. \"The increase comes about in the first 12 to 15 months,\" Case said. \"They're getting remedies on things that actually are underlying conditions [of obesity].\" But by the end of the second year of treatment with the GLP-1 drugs, the medical cost trend for patients taking them slowed by 7% on average, compared to workers with similar chronic conditions and obesity characteristics who were not taking the drugs, Aon found. For those not taking the drug, the medical cost trend was 14%. The biggest driver of those savings was the reduction by more than 40% of major adverse cardiac events such as heart attacks and strokes, compared with patients who were not taking the drugs, as well as a reduction in the onset of diabetes.  Case said with this data, Aon has been able to help clients understand the timeline for seeing a return on providing insurance coverage for GLP-1s for weight loss, in addition to Type 2 diabetes. \"We saw every single place where the cost went down — and it's stunning,\" said Case. \"You can do this in a way that has an ROI, that will literally be an economic return.\" Following its research, Aon has launched a subsidized GLP-1 weight management program for its own U.S. workforce, which includes weekly virtual wellness visits and home blood tests to help employees adhere to the drug regimen.

GE HealthCare reported net income of $564 million, or $1.23 per share, up from $374 million, or 81 cents per share, during the same period last year.

Kennedy Jr.'s   of the Department of Health and Human Services involves deep cuts to several divisions that help protect and improve the health of minority and underserved populations and eliminate health disparities in the U.S., CNBC has learned. Kennedy, the Health and Human Services secretary, has gutted at least seven minority health offices across the department, according to people familiar with the matter, who requested anonymity to speak freely. HHS has laid off a significant share of workers at those offices, or in some cases all of them, along with their directors, the people said. The affected units include the HHS Office of Minority Health and the National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities, or  . The cuts also hit offices with similar functions at the Food and Drug Administration, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, the Health Resources and Services Administration, and the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, according to the people.  Health policy experts told CNBC that deep cuts to those divisions could widen existing health disparities in the U.S., undoing years of progress toward addressing them. Over time, that could worsen health outcomes for already underserved groups, threaten overall public health, strain the U.S. health-care system and drive up health-care costs.  \"It will have negative health impacts, obviously, for groups that they're focused on, so racial and ethnic minorities, but I think what gets missed in the story is it ultimately impacts all of us, no matter what your background is,\" Dr. Stephanie Ettinger De Cuba, research professor of health law, policy and management at Boston University, told CNBC.  \"It's not a zero-sum game. So I think that's what is deeply disturbing to me, as we are going to see people get hurt,\" she said. \"Decimating or cutting staff from these offices ultimately makes it worse for everyone.\" The Trump administration can't shutter the affected offices entirely, which would   since they were authorized by the Affordable Care Act more than a decade ago, the people said. The exact fate of each office and the NIH institute is unclear, they added.  The administration likely hopes to at least \"narrow the scope\" of what NIMHD and the agency offices do, curtailing their authority and limiting resources, said Brandyn Churchill, professor of public administration and policy at American University.  The cuts come as health disparities remain a major challenge in the U.S., affecting not only people of color but also rural residents, low-income communities and individuals with disabilities, among several other groups. These communities often face worse health outcomes – such as lower life expectancy and higher rates of infant mortality and chronic disease – and more limited access to care and other resources than the U.S. population as a whole.  The Covid-19 pandemic deepened many of these gaps, highlighting how the long U.S. history of exclusionary policies and systemic issues such as poverty and racism contribute to unequal health outcomes across the country.  Health policy experts stress that addressing those disparities leads to stronger overall public health, as healthier communities improve outcomes for everyone. It could also relieve a huge economic burden on the U.S: a   found that racial and ethnic health disparities cost the U.S. economy $451 billion in 2018.   Kennedy is consolidating divisions and slashing 10,000 jobs at HHS,   that oversees vaccines and other medicines, scientific research, public health infrastructure, pandemic preparedness, and food and tobacco products. HHS also manages government-funded health care for millions of Americans – including seniors, disabled people and lower-income patients who rely on Medicare, Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act's markets. Kennedy plans to create a new HHS agency called the Administration for a Healthy America, which will combine several existing offices. That includes HRSA, SAMHSA, the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Health, the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry, and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health. A leaked 64-page preliminary budget document also indicates that the HHS Office of Minority Health would fall under that new agency, according to several reports. But that proposal, which would slash the HHS budget by a third, or roughly $40 billion, requires congressional approval.  HHS did not immediately respond to a request for comment. While the breadth of the cutbacks varied at agencies within HHS, the minority health agencies across the departments will now be only a fraction of their former size. All 40 staff members at the CMS Office of Minority Health were laid off, according to the people. CMS plans to appoint a new director for that unit, but the current director has not resigned from the role, CNBC previously  .  The office works with local and federal partners to eliminate disparities in health coverage, aiming to ensure that minority and underserved populations can access Medicare, Medicaid and Affordable Care Act marketplace plans. It also conducts research and analysis to help lower costs and reduce the incidence and severity of chronic diseases in the U.S.  Nearly all staff at the CDC's Office of Minority Health were cut, according to the people. To adhere to the letter of the law, the Trump administration is considering reconstituting that unit and the Office of Women's Health so that each office would be made up of at least one director or a very small group of employees, the people said.  The agency's Office of Minority Health works across CDC to promote research of health disparities and create programs to improve the health of racial and ethnic minority groups. At the FDA's Office of Minority Health and Health Equity, all staff were cut, the people said. The future of that office is unclear.  The unit focuses on efforts such as increasing clinical trial diversity, improving transparency around how medical products affect different populations, and creating health resources tailored to a range of languages and cultures. No staff are left at HRSA's Office of Health Equity after the layoffs, as well as some retirements and reassignments, according to the people. That office leads efforts to reduce disparities in health-care access, quality and outcomes through HRSA, which focuses on people who are uninsured, geographically isolated, or economically and medically vulnerable. The future of that office is also unclear, apart from the Trump administration's plans to fold HRSA into Kennedy's new agency. The same goes for SAMHSA's , which saw all remaining staff cut except for a new, recently hired director, according to the people. The office also had a retirement and one worker on probation who was put on administrative leave.  The office works to ensure that SAMHSA's resources for mental health and substance abuse treatment, including grant programs and other initiatives, are equitably distributed across all communities and populations. Roughly a third of staff are gone at NIMHD, some of whom were laid off and others who left due to early retirements and buyouts, the people said. Some workers on probation were put on leave several weeks before Kennedy started cuts, they said.  The institute's deputy director accepted an offer to be acting director in the short term, the people added. NIMHD, which is part of the National Institutes of Health, works to reduce health disparities through conducting and funding research and developing new programs. The HHS Office of Minority Health also faced cuts, though it's unclear how many staff were impacted, the people said. That office leads the federal effort to improve health outcomes for racial and ethnic minority groups, developing policies and programs and providing funding. It will likely take several months to a year before the U.S. sees direct consequences from the cuts to NIMHD and the offices, said Terry McGovern, professor at the CUNY Graduate School of Public Health and Health Policy. But the staff reductions could cause the U.S. to lose out on crucial data, which is the cornerstone for addressing health disparities, according to Samantha Artiga, director for the racial equity and health policy program at KFF, a health policy research organization.  Artiga said data and research are essential for pinpointing where disparities exist, understanding their root causes, crafting effective solutions, and tracking progress over time. For example, data can reveal whether certain groups experience worse surgical outcomes or wait longer at the emergency room, or if a vaccination program is being equitably distributed across regions. \"Without focused data and research, those disparities may remain unseen and unaddressed, creating blind spots,\" Artiga said, adding that the U.S. would eventually have to rebuild that knowledge in the future.  The fate of many of the grants that NIMHD and some of the offices provide is unclear. That includes  from HHS' Office of Minority Health to 20 organizations for a four-year initiative to identify strategies that increase the use of preventive health services in communities.  But if offices cut back that funding or stop it altogether, it could also weaken the nation's ability to reduce health disparities, Boston University's Ettinger De Cuba said.  Community-based organizations rely on federal money to deliver culturally tailored care to different groups, and could be forced to scale back or shut down programs. The loss of grants could also stall research, innovation and public health interventions by outside entities, such as universities, health-care systems and social service organizations.  \"Philanthropy is not able to step up at this level long term. The only actor that's able to do that is the government,\" Ettinger De Cuba said.  Nathan Boucher, research professor at Duke's Sanford School of Public Policy, added that the cuts will \"degrade any effort of these larger governmental organizations to have any accountability when it comes to protecting the people they help and serve every day.\"  While Kennedy has said his cuts are focused on making HHS more \"responsive and efficient,\" Boucher said targeting minority health offices could do the opposite.  \"I actually think it's an efficiency argument to be able to have these minority health offices, because it allows you to identify and target some real problem areas and use taxpayer dollars in the most efficient way possible,\" said Boucher. ", "summary": null, "related_articles": [], "metadata": {"author": null, "publish_date": "2025-04-30T16:42:17+0000", "read_time": null, "keywords": "Breaking News: Politics,Business,Biotechnology,Biotech and Pharmaceuticals,Pharmaceuticals,Health care industry,Breaking News: Business,Politics,business news"}, "category": "Health and Science"}

But there's a sense of \"cautious optimism\" following some of the company's recent technological developments, including new artificial intelligence features and the   Oracle announced in October. Based on recent comments from Oracle founder Larry Ellison, his company is in a favorable spot.  Ellison spent a lot of time on the subject in   at the company's annual Oracle Health Summit in March. And on Oracle's quarterly call with investors in September, Ellison said his company's EHR is equipped with AI capabilities like transcription and order distribution that make it unique. \"Our user interface is so different than Epic's,\" he said. In a   in May Ken Glueck, an executive vice president at Oracle, went after Epic, calling founder and CEO Judy Faulkner the \"single biggest obstacle to EHR interoperability,\" a term for how different software systems exchange information.

Oracle engineers mistakenly caused a five-day software outage at several Community Health Systems hospitals that was just cleared up this week.

The company now expects full-year adjusted earnings of $6 to $6.20 per share, up from a previous guidance of $5.75 to $6 per share But the company revised its GAAP diluted EPS guidance to be lower, which includes charges related to a legal battle involving its pharmacy services provider subsidiary, Omnicare. A jury this week found Omnicare liable for dispensing drugs without valid prescriptions to elderly and disabled individuals in assisted living and long-term care facilities. CVS plans to appeal. The company did not provide a revenue forecast for the year. CVS said it is \"maintaining a cautious view for the remainder of the year\" in light of continued higher medical costs and \"the potential for macro headwinds.\" \"We got smarter about the markets that we wanted and the lives that we wanted to compete for, and so we actually have planned and budgeted for the elevated trends,\" CVS CEO David Joyner said in an interview with CNBC, referring to markets that the insurance unit operates in and higher medical costs \"So I think why you're not seeing a surprise on our part is because we actually plan for elevated trends going into this year,\" he added. Joyner said the company is watching for the potential impact from President  s planned tariffs on pharmaceuticals imported into the U.S. \"On the pharmacy side, I think it is highly dependent on what happens in the next week or two when they announce the implications of tariffs on the manufacturers,\" he told CNBC. Joyner added that the vast majority of the company's retail products at the front of stores are sourced in the U.S., \"which should be a benefit for us.\" Here's what CVS reported for the first quarter compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:  The company's insurer, Aetna, and its rivals have been dogged by higher-than-expected medical costs over the last year as more Medicare Advantage patients return to hospitals for procedures they delayed during the pandemic. But for the first time in several quarters, CVS' insurance business appeared to show some signs of improvement. The unit's medical benefit ratio — a measure of total medical expenses paid relative to premiums collected — decreased to 87.3% from 90.4% a year earlier. A lower ratio typically indicates that a company collected more in premiums than it paid out in benefits, resulting in higher profitability. CVS said the move partly reflects stronger underlying performance in its Medicare business and improved Medicare Advantage star ratings for the 2025 payment year. Those ratings help patients compare the quality of Medicare health and drug plans. \"I think that investment and talent that allowed us to focus on both the execution and the operation … actually helped establish the performance that you're seeing,\" Joyner said, referring to an executive reshuffling last year that tapped a new leader for the insurance unit and other parts of the business. The results cap off the second full quarter with  , a longtime CVS executive, as chief executive of the retail drugstore chain. Joyner succeeded Karen Lynch in mid-October, as CVS struggled to drive higher profits and improve its stock performance. The company underwent a management reshuffle as part of a broader turnaround plan that includes   in cost cuts over the next several years. Still, CVS' performance was partially offset by a charge of $431 million from so-called premium deficiency reserves in the insurance unit, which is related to anticipated losses in the 2025 coverage year. That refers to a liability that an insurer may need to cover if future premiums are not enough to pay for anticipated claims and expenses. The company posted net income of $1.78 billion, or $1.41 per share, for the first quarter. That compares with net income of $1.12 billion, or 88 cents per share, for the year-earlier period.  Excluding certain items, such as amortization of intangible assets, restructuring charges and capital losses, adjusted earnings were $2.25 per share for the quarter. CVS booked sales of $94.59 billion for the first quarter, up 7% from the same period a year ago due to growth across all three of its business segments.  But sales in the company's retail pharmacy segment missed Wall Street's expectations for the quarter, according to StreetAccount. That business has been pressured by softer consumer spending and lower reimbursements for prescription drugs.  CVS' insurance business booked $34.81 billion in revenue during the quarter, up 8% from the first quarter of 2024. Analysts expected the unit to take in $33.51 billion for the period, according to estimates from StreetAccount. The unit also recorded adjusted operating income of $1.99 billion for the first quarter, compared with $732 million for the year-earlier period.  Also on Thursday, CVS said Aetna will stop offering health insurance plans on the Affordable Care Act marketplaces — also known as individual exchanges — starting in the 2026 plan year. CVS' pharmacy and consumer wellness division booked $31.91 billion in sales for the first quarter, up more than 11% from the same period a year earlier. But that was far under the $35.27 billion that analysts were expecting for the quarter, according to StreetAccount. That unit dispenses prescriptions in CVS' more than 9,000 retail pharmacies and provides other pharmacy services, such as vaccinations and diagnostic testing. CVS' health services segment generated $43.46 billion in revenue for the quarter, up nearly 8% compared with the same quarter in 2024. Analysts expected the unit to post $43.64 billion in sales for the period, according to StreetAccount. That unit includes Caremark, one of the nation's largest pharmacy benefit managers.

The move is part of a new partnership between Caremark and Wegovy's manufacturer,  , according to CVS'   release. Caremark will also drop the weight loss drug Zepbound from its standard formularies on that date, in a blow to its manufacturer,  , a CVS spokesperson told CNBC. They said those standard formularies are the most common among Caremark's client base, representing tens of millions of patients. Eligible patients covered by Caremark who are currently taking Zepbound will be able to switch to Wegovy, the spokesperson said. Shares of Novo Nordisk closed around 1% lower on Thursday, while Eli Lilly's stock closed more than 11% lower.  It comes as Novo Nordisk works to boost access to Wegovy now that it is no longer in   in the U.S. Partnering with Caremark, one of the nation's largest pharmacy benefit managers, could help the drugmaker reach even more patients. Caremark discounts drugs with manufacturers on behalf of insurance plans and creates lists of medications, or formularies, that are covered by insurance and reimburses pharmacies for prescriptions. Caremark will make the drug available to its members at \"a more affordable price.\" The PBM negotiated a lower net price for Wegovy over Zepbound on its standard formularies, offering savings to clients that opt into those plans, the CVS spokesperson said. But Caremark's clients, which are employers and unions, \"individually determine how much of that savings on Wegovy gets shared with its members either via lower premiums or lower copays at the pharmacy counter,\" the spokesperson said.  Separately, any patient who does not have insurance coverage for Wegovy or another GLP-1 can still buy Novo Nordisk's drug out-of-pocket for $499 at any of CVS' 9,000 pharmacies nationwide, the spokesperson added.  In its earnings release, CVS said it is the first retail pharmacy partnering with Novo Nordisk's new direct-to-consumer online pharmacy,  , to dispense Wegovy to patients with prescriptions. NovoCare offers Wegovy at that lower price point to cash-paying patients, who may struggle to shoulder the drug's roughly $1,000 list price before insurance and other rebates. Caremark will also combine Wegovy with additional lifestyle support, such as personalized nutrition plans, as part of the CVS Weight Management program. The announcement comes as the Danish drugmaker races to capture more patients now that many compounding pharmacies are legally restricted from making cheaper, unapproved versions of Wegovy, with rare exceptions. \"It's unknown at this point how the migration from the compound pharmacies into other pharmacy settings are going to occur,\" CVS Health group president Prem Shah said on an earnings call on Thursday. \"But we do expect that there will be obviously some benefit by opening up 9,000 stores, or 9,000 opportunities for patients to be able to get the medication.\" Dave Moore, Novo Nordisk's executive vice president of U.S. operations, said in a separate release on Thursday that \"it is our responsibility to continue to work with others across the US healthcare system to find innovative opportunities to meet the needs of these patients and connect them with authentic, FDA-approved Wegovy … in a convenient and affordable way.\"", "summary": null, "related_articles": [], "metadata": {"author": null, "publish_date": "2025-05-01T10:31:30+0000", "read_time": null, "keywords": "Breaking News: Business,Health care industry,Pharmaceuticals,Biotech and Pharmaceuticals,Biotechnology,Business,CVS Health Corp,Novo Nordisk A/S,Novo Nordisk A/S,LILLY DRN,business news"}, "category": "Health and Science"}

The pharmaceutical giant now expects its adjusted fiscal 2025 earnings to come in between $20.78 and $22.28 per share, down from previous guidance of $22.50 to $24 per share. Eli Lilly said the revision reflects a $1.57 billion deal charge recorded in the first quarter, which is primarily related to its acquisition of a certain oral cancer drug from Scorpion Therapeutics. The company maintained its fiscal 2025 sales guidance of $58 billion to $61 billion. Eli Lilly said the guidance reflects President  's existing tariffs as of May 1, but does not include his planned levies on pharmaceuticals imported into the U.S. In an interview with CNBC, Eli Lilly CEO Dave Ricks said the company and other drugmakers are already announcing  , which is one of the Trump administration's stated goals of the tariffs. \"I think that actually the threat of tariffs is already bringing back critical supply chains into important industries, chips and pharma,\" Ricks said. \"So do we need to enact [tariffs?] I'm not so sure.\" He added that Eli Lilly wants to see permanently lower tax rates in the U.S., particularly 15% for domestic production. Ricks said lower taxes drove many drugmakers to manufacture in \"low-tax islands like Ireland Singapore and in Switzerland, and that can come back if there's an economic incentive.\" Eli Lilly's blockbuster diabetes treatment Mounjaro topped expectations for the first quarter, raking in $3.84 billion in revenue. That's up a whopping 113% from the same period a year ago. The company's weight loss drug Zepbound also beat estimates, booking $2.31 billion in sales for the quarter. That more than quadrupled the $517.4 million that the treatment brought in a year ago, when it had just entered the U.S. market. Analysts expected Mounjaro and Zepbound to generate $3.81 billion and $2.28 billion in sales, respectively, according to estimates from StreetAccount. Shares of Eli Lilly closed more than 11% on Thursday. That came after   on Thursday said its pharmacy benefit manager would make   Wegovy the preferred weight loss medication on its main formularies instead of Zepbound. Here's what Eli Lilly reported for the first quarter compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:  The company posted first-quarter revenue of $12.73 billion, up 45% from the same period a year ago.  Sales in the U.S. jumped 49% to $8.49 billion. Eli Lilly said that was driven by a 57% increase in volume – or the number of prescriptions or units sold – for Zepbound and Mounjaro. That was partially offset by lower realized prices of the drugs, the company said. The pharmaceutical giant booked net income of $2.76 billion, or $3.06 per share, for the first quarter. That compares with net income of $2.24 billion, or $2.48 share, a year earlier.  Excluding one-time items associated with the value of intangible assets and other adjustments, Eli Lilly posted earnings of $3.34 per share for the first quarter. Demand in the U.S. has still far outpaced supply of Zepbound and Mounjaro over the last year. Both so-called incretin treatments mimic certain gut hormones to tamp down a person's appetite and regulate their blood sugar. The popularity of those injectable drugs has forced both Eli Lilly and its rival   to invest billions to ramp up manufacturing capacity for their treatments. The efforts appear to be paying off: The Food and Drug Administration in December   to declare the U.S. shortage of tirzepatide — the active ingredient in Zepbound and Mounjaro — over.

He spoke after Eli Lilly  , which did not include estimated effects of the potential pharmaceutical tariffs. He said national security concerns around those medications are \"valid.\" But he added: \"Do I think tariffs are the answer to that? I'm not so sure personally.\" \"We would be happy to talk to this administration or national security people about how we could respond to such a crisis,\" he said. \"We have capacities to bring to bear there, and we're happy to help the country if we're in need.\" Older generic drugs account for about  prescribed in the U.S. Many are critical for hospital care, including antibiotics and vasopressors, or medications that raise blood pressure.  Ricks noted that those essential drugs are \"not easy to make, but they're cheap, and they've been driven out of our country due to cost and other damaging policies.\" However, some health experts previously told CNBC that tariffs on generic drugs, which have far lower profit margins than branded medications, could force some generic drugmakers to leave the U.S. market altogether. That could lead to or exacerbate shortages of certain generic drugs in the U.S., such as sterile injectable drugs commonly used in hospitals. Rick's comments come as drugmakers brace for President  's planned pharmaceutical tariffs, which aim to boost domestic manufacturing. Those tariff threats are already   of U.S. manufacturing investments from the pharmaceutical industry.

References to the insect were abundant at the company's old headquarters in London, where a picture of a cockroach was prominently displayed on the wall. For much of Hinge's 10-year history, the cockroach was the unofficial mascot. Staffers named it Flossy after the viral dance move \"the floss.\" Perez relishes the symbolism. In his determination to build a company that will push through adversity, he's encouraged employees to think of themselves like cockroaches, due to the creature's grimy resilience and noted ability to survive harsh conditions. \"It was the identity of every individual in the company,\" said Joshua Sturm, a vice president at Hinge from 2019 to 2024 and now chief revenue officer at cancer prevention startup Color Health. \"We are all in this together, and no matter what happens, we are going to survive together.\" Perez and his 1,400-person workforce now face the ultimate test of their mettle. Hinge, which moved from London to San Francisco in 2017, is trying to go public at a time of such extreme economic uncertainty and market volatility that several companies, including online lender   and ticket marketplace  , have delayed their long-awaited IPOs. Hinge filed its prospectus  , announcing plans to trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol \"HNGE.\" Three weeks later,   announced a sweeping tariff policy that plunged U.S. markets into turmoil after tariff concerns had already pushed the Nasdaq to its worst quarter since 2022. But Hinge, led by its 39-year-old co-founder and CEO, appears determined to power through the chaos. Hinge declined to comment or make Perez available for an interview.  Going public was already going to be a risky endeavor for Hinge. The IPO market has been   since late 2021, when soaring inflation and rising interest rates pushed investors out of risky assets. Within digital health, it's been almost completely dead. Health-tech companies have struggled to adapt to a more muted growth environment following the Covid pandemic, and many once promising business models haven't panned out as planned. The starkest example is virtual health company  , which has a market cap of just over $1 billion less than five years after buying digital health provider Livongo in a deal that valued the   at $37 billion. Teladoc's BetterHelp mental health unit has been a particularly troublesome business as paying users dropped off in the years following the pandemic. Over time, Hinge's Cockroach Award transitioned from a monthly prize to a quarterly distinction. The company phased it out entirely about a year ago in preparation for its next public-facing chapter, but the survive-at-all-costs mentality persists, according to current employees. Now, staffers are recognized with the \"Movers Awards,\" a nod to the company's focus on movement. \"We have many decades of work ahead,\" Perez wrote in a letter to investors in March. \"We hope you join us on this journey.\" CNBC spoke to 13 current and former Hinge employees, investors, and people close to Perez for this story, some of whom asked not to be named in order to provide candid commentary. Hinge uses software to help patients treat acute musculoskeletal injuries, chronic pain and carry out post-surgery rehabilitation remotely. Large employers like   and   cover the costs so their employees can access Hinge's app-based virtual physical therapy, as well as its wearable electrical nerve stimulation device called Enso.  The company   its technology can help users manage pain, cut down health-care costs and reduce the need for surgery and opioids. Revenue increased 33% to $390.4 million last year, while its net loss narrowed to $11.9 million from $108.1 million a year earlier, according to the prospectus. Hinge's roster of clients expanded by 36% last year to 2,256, and the number of individual members jumped 44% to over 532,300, the filing said. In an   on Monday, Hinge   revenue in its first quarter climbed 50% to $123.8 million, up from $82.7 million during the same period last year, and that net income for the period was $17.1 million compared to a loss of $26.5 million a year ago.  Hinge has raised more than $1 billion from investors including Tiger Global Management and Coatue Management, and it boasted a   as of October 2021, the last time the company raised outside funding. The biggest institutional shareholders are venture firms Insight Partners and Atomico, which own 19% and 15% of the stock, respectively, according to the filing. Perez and Gabriel Mecklenburg, Hinge's executive chairman, started the company in 2014. The pair met while they were both pursuing PhDs in the U.K. — Perez at the University of Oxford and Mecklenburg at Imperial College London. They were distracted students, according to Perez's twin brother, David.  By the time they launched Hinge, Perez and Mecklenburg had already co-founded two other ventures together. One was the Oxbridge Biotech Roundtable, an organization that connected academics and industry experts. The other was Marblar, which worked to commercialize academic intellectual property. Perez took a leave of absence from Oxford while working on Marblar and never returned. His brother wasn't a fan of the decision initially. \"I gave him terrible advice,\" said David Perez, a graduate of Yale Law School and partner at Perkins Coie in Seattle. \"I was like, 'I think you're an idiot, I think you should focus on your PhD. Only an idiot would not finish a PhD at Oxford.'\"  The twins have two older siblings. Their mother immigrated from Cuba in 1968, followed 12 years later by their father. Their parents met in Miami, got married after just three dates, and are still together after more than 40 years.  The family moved from Miami to Salt Lake City, Utah, in 1990. Perez's mother was a substitute teacher and his father worked at restaurants as a dishwasher and busboy. David Perez said their father \"worked around the clock\" and used to call out orders in his sleep.  \"It wasn't a lot of money, I think combined they made about $19,000 a year,\" David Perez said. \"But they stitched it together and raised four kids.\"  The twin boys were competitive, particularly when it came to academics and playing basketball in the driveway. David said his brother got \"great grades\" and always had an inclination toward science and medicine, graduating from high school at age 16 and then starting college at Westminster University, a small liberal arts school in Utah. \"I swear,\" David Perez said, \"there were times where the only punishment that my mom could issue that would have the sting was restricting our ability to do homework.\" Perez was a student in the Honors College at Westminster, and he graduated with a degree in biology. Richard Badenhausen, dean of the Honors College, described Perez as an independent thinker and an ambitious student, especially for his age.  \"He didn't care too much what people thought about him, which is a strength in my book,\" Badenhausen said in an interview.  When Perez was 13, he was hit by a car. He broke an arm and a leg, and had to be airlifted to a nearby hospital. After three surgeries and 12 months of rehab, he had a newfound interest in orthopedics and physical therapy.  Mecklenburg had a serious injury of his own, tearing his anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) during a judo match, which also required a year of rehab, according to Hinge's website. One day in October 2014  the pair put their heads together and outlined the tools they wished were available while undergoing physical therapy. Musculoskeletal conditions affect as many as 1.7 billion people worldwide, according to Hinge's prospectus, so there was no shortage of opportunities. They had the early concept of Hinge within hours and a prototype ready by December of that year. In Hinge's early days, Perez and Mecklenburg would meet every Saturday morning to talk shop. Now, as they've aged and started families, they meet on Wednesday nights, according to colleagues. Perez welcomed his first child with his wife late last year.  \"Seeing the growth over the last six, seven, eight years has just been unbelievable,\" said Jon Reynolds, a tech founder who contributed to Hinge's seed funding round. \"That comes down to the quality of Dan and Gabriel as leaders. They complement each other really well, and they've obviously got that mutual respect.\" Perez is a hands-on CEO who expects a lot from his staff.  He's direct, detail-oriented, opinionated, competitive and can be intense, according to current and former employees. But he's committed to the mission and the wellbeing of his employees, they said. \"He's one of those rare founder CEOs who I think can go all the way,\" said Paul Kruszewski, a former Hinge employee who joined the company after it acquired his Canadian computer vision startup, Wrnch, in 2021.  Employees say Perez is a voracious reader, often finishing two to four books a month. That includes books about business and leadership, an important source of information given that Hinge was his first real job. He's a fan of \"The Innovator's Prescription,\" by   and others, \"Crossing the Chasm,\" by Geoffrey Moore and \"The Long Fix,\" by Dr. Vivian Lee. He also likes his staffers to read. Executives will often prepare to discuss chapters from a book in their meetings.  \"I'd come home and there'd be a package from Dan, and it's a book,\" said Sturm, who led partnerships and new market development at Hinge. \"That was just the norm.\" Sturm, who has worked in the health-care and benefits space for around 30 years, said Hinge was very deliberate with hiring, so there wasn't a lot of turnover among senior executives. He said Hinge's recruitment process was the hardest he's ever experienced.  Another \"Dan-ism,\" as Sturm called it, is Hinge's philosophy around writing. Perez has employees write memos, typically up to six pages long, instead of preparing slide decks or other materials ahead of meetings. Perez was inspired by a similar practice at  , according to current and former employees, and sees it as a way to force employees to think through what they want to say instead of hiding behind bullet points. Hinge's memo culture can be an adjustment, particularly for new employees. Sturm said he thought the practice was \"insane\" at first, but ultimately came to appreciate it and said it improved his pitches. \"When you sort of sit back, you go, 'You know actually, he wasn't wrong,'\" Sturm said.  Hinge has come a long way since venture firm Atomico led the $8 million Series A investment in 2017. The London-based firm said in a   at the time that it was \"extremely impressed by Daniel and Gabriel, and their determination to tackle a big problem in society.\" Carolina Brochado led the round, though she left Atomico a year later and now works at investment firm EQT Group. She said that getting Hinge to the brink of an IPO was a \"one in a million chance,\" but noted that the company has managed to build a sizable business in digital health despite having so many odds stacked against it. \"Lots of learnings along the way, of course, like a big tech correction in the middle,\" Brochado said in an interview. \"But it really is one of those rare examples of just an enormous market that was under penetrated.\" For David Perez, whose firm now serves as Hinge's outside counsel, watching the startup grow has been \"fascinating,\" he said. \"I'm a partner at a major law firm,\" he said, \"and I am only the second most successful twin.

The company said adding Ezra's scanning technology to its platform will allow its users to screen for more conditions and access a more complete picture of their health. \"It makes so much sense,\" Jonathan Swerdlin, the co-founder and CEO of Function, said in an interview. \"What labs aren't covering, scans can see, and what scans couldn't touch on, labs cover.\" Function and Ezra declined to disclose the financial details of the acquisition.  Before Monday's announcement, Ezra's cheapest offering was a 30-minute scan that cost participants $1,495.  Ezra, founded in 2018, offers a range of full-body MRI scans that can help patients   and other conditions. The company partners with existing imaging facilities across more than 70 locations in the U.S., according to its website.  Full-body MRI scans have surged in popularity in recent years after celebrities like Kim Kardashian began posting about them on social media.

Ezra's primary competitor is  , another full-body   startup. In February, Prenuvo announced that it closed a $120 million funding round, and it also launched a new blood test to provide insights into patients' hormonal, cardiovascular, metabolic and immune health.  Ezra has raised a total of $44 million from investors, while Function has raised a total of $53 million as of June 2024. Function is reportedly seeking more than $200 million in fresh capital at a valuation of around $2 billion, according to a February report from . Emi Gal, the founder and CEO of Ezra, said he has known Function's Swerdlin for years, and that the two began chatting last year about potentially collaborating through a commercial partnership. Over time, though, he said it became clear that an acquisition ultimately made more sense.    \"I'm pinching myself,\" Gal said in an interview. \"This is just a phenomenal outcome.\" The company was able to shorten its new scan time to 22 minutes by leveraging artificial intelligence that was cleared by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in January, Gal said. The AI, as well as Function's \"financial prowess,\" helped reduce the price of the scan to $499, he added. The new 22-minute scan will be available to Function members starting on Monday. Function does not publicly disclose how many patients subscribe to its platform, but Swerdlin said it's in the \"hundreds of thousands.\"  Dr. Mark Hyman, co-founder and the chief medical officer of Function, said acquiring Ezra was a natural part of Function's evolution.   \"What used to be the domain of the wealthy is now accessible to everybody, including comprehensive imaging,\" Hyman said in an interview. \"It truly makes a difference for people and saves lives.\"", "summary": null, "related_articles": [], "metadata": {"author": null, "publish_date": "2025-05-05T16:00:01+0000", "read_time": null, "keywords": "Health care industry,Enterprise,Internet,Technology,Breaking News: Technology,business news"}, "category": "Health and Science"}

In lawsuits filed Wednesday, Lilly accuses the sites — Mochi Health, Fella Health, Willow Health and Henry Meds — of deceiving consumers about \"untested, unapproved drugs\" and turning them away from Lilly's medicines. Lilly alleges the companies are claiming to offer personalized options when they are actually mass-marketing slightly different versions of Lilly's drugs in order to skirt FDA rules. Lilly also claims some of the sites are selling formulations of the drugs that haven't been studied, such as oral tablets and drops. Fella, Willow and Henry Meds didn't immediately respond to CNBC's requests for comment. Mochi Health in a statement said its model \"remains compliant with FDA guidance and pharmacy regulations.\"  Lilly's diabetes drug Mounjaro went into short supply in late 2022, allowing pharmacies and outsourcing facilities to produce the treatment, a practice called compounding. Novo Nordisk's weight loss drug Wegovy was also in short supply, opening up the market for compounding GLP-1s. That business boomed online, where people sought versions of the treatments if they couldn't find the brand names or couldn't get them covered by insurance. Mass compounding of tirzepatide, the active ingredient in Mounjaro and Zepbound, was supposed to stop last month after the Food and Drug Administration declared the shortage of the drugs over. Some pharmacies kept doing it anyway, producing versions that differ slightly from the brand name, which could possibly keep them out of the FDA's crosshairs.

Asked whether she feared legal action from Lilly, Ahmad said she wasn't worried about her prescribers since \"they have established patient-physician relationships\" and \"the beauty of medicine is really that they get full autonomy to decide what is the best way to manage their patients.\" Lilly in its filing Wednesday claimed Ahmad is not a licensed physician and that Mochi and its \"unlicensed owners exercise undue influence and control over, among other things, the prescribing decisions of physicians\" and as a result engage in the \"unlawful corporate practice of medicine.\" Ahmad in a statement said the use of compounded medications \"remains appropriate and legal when tailored to individual patient needs and prescribed by a licensed medical provider\" and that Mochi's physicians choose which treatments are best for their patients. She said she holds a doctor of medicine degree but is not practicing as CEO of Mochi. Lilly makes a similar allegation against Fella Health, accusing the company of making \"sweeping corporate decisions that dictate patient care, such as when Fella changed patients en masse from one tirzepatide formulation to another with additives.\" In all four cases, Lilly is seeking to stop the sites from marketing or selling tirzepatide.

The company now expects its 2025 adjusted earnings to come in between $8.82 and $8.97, down slightly from a previous outlook of $8.88 to $9.03 per share. The company said the expected tariff charge primarily reflects levies between the U.S. and China, and Canada and Mexico to a lesser degree. Merck has built a robust presence in China, which is considered one of the company's most important markets and is home to some of its partners and manufacturing and research and development sites.  Merck noted that the new outlook does not account for President  's planned tariffs on pharmaceuticals imported into the U.S., which are prompting some drugmakers to   footprints.  That includes Merck, which has invested $12 billion in U.S. manufacturing and research and development and expects to put more than $9 billion more into the country by the end of 2028. On an earnings call on Thursday, Merck CEO Rob Davis said that \"as you look at 2025, we're well positioned with inventory to be able to mitigate anything we could see in the short term.\" He added that in the medium to long term, \"we've already started to identify where we can either reposition our own manufacturing,\" which could look like changing the priorities of existing plants, or bring on external manufacturing to \"bridge gaps\" and build internal production further. \"In many ways, we are aligned with what the administration is wanting to do, and feel that we're in position to be able to do that quite effectively,\" he said. The new guidance does include a one-time charge of roughly 6 cents per share related to the company's license agreement with Hengrui Pharma, which it   in March. Merck reiterated its full-year sales forecast of between $64.1 billion and $65.6 billion.  Also on Thursday, the drugmaker reported first-quarter revenue and profit that beat expectations, as it said it saw strength in its oncology portfolio and animal health products.  Merck also cited \"increasingly meaningful\" sales contributions from two recently launched drugs. They are Winrevair, which is used to treat a rare, deadly lung condition, and Capvaxive, a vaccine designed to protect adults from a bacteria known as pneumococcus that can cause serious illnesses and lung infection.  Sales of those drugs will likely be critical to Merck's efforts to offset losses from its top-selling cancer therapy Keytruda, which will lose exclusivity in 2028.  Here's what Merck reported for the first quarter compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:  The company posted net income of $5.08 billion, or $2.01 per share, for the quarter. That compares with net income of $4.76 billion, or $1.87 per share, during the year-earlier period.  Excluding acquisition and restructuring costs, Merck earned $2.22 per share for the first quarter.  Merck raked in $15.53 billion in revenue for the quarter, down 2% from the same period a year ago. Merck's pharmaceutical unit, which develops a wide range of drugs, booked $13.64 billion in revenue during the first quarter. That's down 3% from the same period a year ago. Keytruda recorded $7.21 billion in revenue during the quarter, up just 4% from the year-earlier period.  That increase was driven by higher uptake of Keytruda for earlier-stage cancers and strong demand for the drug for metastatic cancers, which spread to other parts of the body. Still, sales came under the $7.43 billion that analysts had expected, according to StreetAccount estimates.   Notably, Merck continued to see   of Gardasil, a vaccine that prevents cancer from HPV, the most common sexually transmitted infection in the U.S.  In February, Merck announced a decision to halt shipments of Gardasil into China beginning that month and going through at least mid-2025. Investors will likely be looking for updates on that effort during the earnings call on Thursday.  The Chinese market makes up the majority of the blockbuster shot's international revenue. Merck is hoping that Gardasil's expanded approval for men ages 9 to 26 in China will help boost uptake of the vaccine. Gardasil raked in $1.33 billion in sales, down 41% from the first quarter of 2024 primarily due to lower demand in China. That's below the $1.45 billion that analysts were expecting, according to StreetAccount estimates.  China has retaliated with tariffs of 125% on goods from the U.S. Some experts said China's tariffs on U.S. products could lead to increased prices or limited supply of some popular Western medicines for Chinese patients, Reuters  . Merck's animal health division, which develops vaccines and medicines for dogs, cats and cattle, posted nearly $1.59 billion in sales, up 5% from the same period a year ago.

The company now expects 2025 revenue to come in between $45.8 billion and $46.8 billion, up from a   of around $45.5 billion. Bristol Myers also projects full-year adjusted earnings of $6.70 to $7 per share, which compares with its prior forecast of $6.55 to $6.85 per share.  Notably, the company said its guidance revisions include the estimated impact of current tariffs on U.S. products shipped to China. China is a critical market for Bristol Myers. The company has   its \"China 2030 Strategy,\" which is a   to bring more of its medicines to the nation to address unmet medical needs in areas like gastric cancer and include more Chinese patients in clinical trials. But the new outlooks do not account for any of President  s planned tariffs on pharmaceuticals imported into the U.S., Bristol Myers said.  In an earnings call Thursday, Bristol Myers Squibb CEO Christopher Boerner said the company appreciated the Trump administration's efforts to increase U.S. manufacturing, but noted that it \"needs to be done in a very thoughtful and deliberate way\" in the pharmaceutical sector. He added that it is \"simply too early to provide a lot more\" on the company's expectations for pharmaceutical-specific tariffs. Still, Bristol Myers is continuing \"mitigation efforts\" to reduce risks of any disruption to the supply chain and shortages, Boerner said. \"We have a tremendous amount of flexibility to be able to move our manufacturing around should any potential tariffs come up,\" said the company's CFO David Elkins on the call. He added that Bristol Myers has a broad global manufacturing network, which includes a significant presence in the U.S. Bristol Myers said the outlook hike reflects strength in its portfolio of newer drug brands, and better-than-anticipated first-quarter sales from its legacy portfolio of older medications.  The results come as Bristol Myers moves to slash $2 billion in expenses by the end of 2027, which is on top of $1.5 billion in planned cost cuts by the end of this year.  It also comes just days after Bristol Myers' recently approved schizophrenia drug, Cobenfy,  , leading some Wall Street analysts to substantially lower their multibillion-dollar sales forecasts for the treatment.   The company is banking on Cobenfy and other so-called growth portfolio drugs to offset the loss in revenue from top-selling treatments slated to lose exclusivity on the market, including its blockbuster blood thinner Eliquis and cancer immunotherapy Opdivo.  Boerner said \"there's a lot of uncertainty, whether related to tariffs, a potential economic downturn or restructuring at the FDA and HHS.\" He is referring to the Trump administration's efforts to   the Food and Drug Administration and other federal health agencies under the Department of Health and Human Services. But the company remains confident in its ability \"to deliver for our patients, employees and shareholders,\" he said. Here is what Bristol Myers reported for the first quarter compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:  Bristol Myers posted net income of $2.5 billion, or $1.20 per share, for the first quarter. That compares with a net loss of $11.9 billion, or a loss of $5.89 per share, for the year-earlier period.  Excluding certain items, it reported adjusted earnings per share of $1.80 for the quarter.  The pharmaceutical giant's revenue fell 6% from the same period a year ago to $11.2 billion.  Eliquis booked $3.57 billion in sales for the quarter, down 4% from the year-ago period. That is above the $3.34 billion that analysts were expecting, according to estimates compiled by StreetAccount. The blood thinner, which Bristol Myers shares with  , is expected to lose market exclusivity by 2028.  Sales of Eliquis could also take a hit in 2026, when a   for the drug goes into effect for certain Medicare patients following negotiations with the federal government. Those price talks are a key provision of the Inflation Reduction Act. The   targets 15 additional drugs and will set new prices that will go into effect in 2028.

That came in response to a February lawsuit from a compounding trade group against the Food and Drug Administration's determination that the active ingredient in those drugs, semaglutide, is no longer in shortage in the U.S. Patients flocked to the cheaper copycats when Ozempic and Wegovy were in short supply over the last two years due to skyrocketing demand, or if they didn't have insurance coverage for the costly treatments.  During  , pharmacists can legally make compounded versions of brand-name medications. Many telehealth companies, such as  , also offered those copycats. But drugmakers and some health experts have pushed back against the practice because the FDA does not approve compounded drugs, which are essentially custom-made copies prescribed by a doctor to meet a specific patient's needs.  \"We are pleased the court has rejected the compounders' attempts to undermine FDA's data-based decision that the shortage\" of semaglutide is resolved, said Steve Benz, Novo Nordisk's corporate vice president, legal and U.S. general counsel, in a statement.  \"Patient safety remains a top priority for Novo Nordisk and the extensive nationwide legal actions we have taken to protect Americans from the health risks posed by illegitimate 'semaglutide' drugs are working,\" he said, referring to the company's more than 100 lawsuits against compounding pharmacies and other entities across 32 states.  On Thursday, U.S. District Judge Mark Pittman specifically denied the Outsourcing Facilities Association's bid for a preliminary injunction that would have prevented the FDA from taking action against its members for making copies of semaglutide.  That decision upholds the FDA's previous determination that the semaglutide shortage in the U.S. is over and means the FDA can now immediately go after so-called 503A pharmacies that are making compounded versions of semaglutide according to individual prescriptions for a specific patient. Those pharmacies are largely regulated by states rather than the FDA. The decision also means the FDA can start targeting federally regulated 503B pharmacies, which manufacture compounded drugs in bulk with or without prescriptions, after May 22. The agency's actions can include product seizures and warning letters to pharmacies.  The decision on Thursday follows another win for Novo Nordisk. A different federal judge in Texas earlier this week ruled in favor of the drugmaker against a 503A pharmacy, MediOak Pharmacy, permanently prohibiting the business from marketing or selling compounded semaglutide.

Eli Lilly has gone through a   with tirzepatide, the active ingredient in its weight loss drug Zepbound and diabetes treatment Mounjaro. The FDA declared the U.S. shortage of tirzepatide over last year, prompting the same compounding trade group to sue the FDA over the drug.  In March, a federal judge denied the compounding group's request for a preliminary injunction on the FDA's enforcement against its members for making copies of Mounjaro and Zepbound.

The company previously said its cost-cutting program would deliver overall net cost savings of roughly $4.5 billion by the end of 2025. On Tuesday, Pfizer said it now expects additional savings of roughly $1.2 billion, primarily in selling, informational and administrative expenses, by the end of 2027.  The company said that will be driven in large part by \"enhanced digital enablement,\" including automation and artificial intelligence and streamlining business processes. The expanded cuts also include expected research and development reorganization cost savings of around $500 million by the end of 2026, the company added. Those savings will be reinvested into Pfizer's product pipeline.  Pfizer has a  to slash costs, with the first phase of the effort slated to deliver $1.5 billion in savings by the end of 2027. With the added cuts announced Tuesday, Pfizer now expects to deliver around $7.7 billion in savings by the end of that year from the two cost-cutting efforts. The cuts aim to help the pharmaceutical giant recover from the rapid decline of its Covid business and stock price over the last few years, and appear to be paying off. Here's what the company reported for the   compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:  The results come as drugmakers brace for President  's planned tariffs on pharmaceuticals imported into the U.S. – his administration's bid to boost U.S. manufacturing of medications.  Unlike other companies grappling with evolving trade policy, Pfizer did not revise its outlook. The company maintained its full-year 2025 outlook, forecasting sales of $61 billion to $64 billion, with a similar performance from its Covid products as seen in 2024, however Pfizer noted in its earnings release that the guidance \"does not currently include any potential impact related to future tariffs and trade policy changes, which we are unable to predict at this time.\" But on the earnings call on Tuesday, Pfizer executives said the guidance does reflect $150 million in costs from Trump's existing tariffs. \"Included in our guidance that we didn't really speak about is there are some tariffs in place today,\" Pfizer CFO Dave Denton said on the call. \"We are contemplating that within our guidance range and we continue to again trend to the top end of our guidance range even with those costs to be incurred this year,\" he said. On the call, Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla said the company established a team to analyze a range of potential outcomes and develop strategies to help mitigate the potential impact of tariffs on its business in the short and long term. That team is managing current inventory levels in certain jurisdictions and leveraging Pfizer's domestic manufacturing footprint, among other efforts. \"Should we be impacted by further tariffs in the future, we will assess the impact of the policies enacted and provide information at the appropriate time,\" Bourla said. He added that uncertainty around Trump's pharmaceutical tariffs is deterring the company from further investing in U.S. manufacturing and research and development. Pfizer still expects that   resulting from the Inflation Reduction Act will hurt sales by $1 billion, dampening growth by approximately 1.6% compared with 2024. Stripping out one-time items, the company expects 2025 earnings to be in the range of $2.80 to $3 a share.  \"With the underlying strength of our business, we believe we can be agile in navigating an uncertain and volatile external environment,\" Bourla said in a release. For the first quarter, the company booked net income of $2.97 billion, or 52 cents per share. That compares with net income of $3.12 billion, or 55 cents per share, during the same period a year ago.  Excluding certain items, including restructuring charges and costs associated with intangible assets, the company posted earnings per share of 92 cents for the quarter. Pfizer reported revenue of $13.72 billion for the first quarter, down 8% from the same period a year ago. The company said the decrease in sales was primarily driven by a decline in revenue for Paxlovid, which posted $491 million in sales during the first quarter, down 76% from the same period a year ago, in part due to lower Covid infections worldwide and reduced international government purchases of the drug. The drop in sales also reflects a boost Pfizer got in the first quarter of 2024 from a final adjustment related to a previously recorded revenue reversal for Paxlovid.  Analysts had expected Paxlovid to generate $769.7 million in sales for the first quarter, according to StreetAccount estimates. Meanwhile, the company's Covid shot, Comirnaty, booked $565 million in revenue, up 60% from the same period a year ago. That's above the $352 million that analysts were expecting, according to StreetAccount. The results come as shot makers like Pfizer face uncertainty over immunization policy and regulation under Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a prominent vaccine skeptic who now oversees the nation's federal health agencies. As secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, Kennedy has pursued a sweeping overhaul of different agencies, cutting staff, consolidating or eliminating offices and taking actions that could ultimately undermine vaccines.", "summary": null, "related_articles": [], "metadata": {"author": null, "publish_date": "2025-04-29T10:59:28+0000", "read_time": null, "keywords": "Breaking News: Earnings,Earnings,Pfizer Inc,Business,Biotechnology,Biotech and Pharmaceuticals,Pharmaceuticals,Health care industry,Breaking News: Business,Dividends,United States,Albert Bourla,Donald J.

The Danish drugmaker is racing to capture more patients now that many compounding pharmacies are legally restricted from making cheaper, unapproved versions of  , with rare exceptions. Patients flocked to those compounded versions while Wegovy was in shortage due to skyrocketing demand.  \"We felt it was really important to work hard to establish a collaboration with telehealth companies so that there could be access to Wegovy as the compounding is winding down,\" Dave Moore, executive vice president of U.S. operations at Novo Nordisk, told CNBC.  \"We're really pleased about the level of interest to access branded Wegovy and to start to sort of catch people as they come off of compounded medicine,\" he said.  Moore added that the new partnerships make the experience \"seamless\" for patients since it allows them to access Wegovy straight from their telehealth providers, which \"makes it very easy\" for them to get the drug shipped directly to their homes.  Patients will be able to access Novo Nordisk's new direct-to-consumer online pharmacy,  , directly through the   providers.  That pharmacy offers Wegovy for $499 in cash per month – roughly half its usual monthly list price  – for patients without insurance coverage for the weekly injection.  Each telehealth company's price may be higher because they likely include additional services, a Novo Nordisk spokesperson told CNBC.  Hims & Hers said it will begin offering all dose sizes of Wegovy along with access to 24/7 care, nutritional guidance and ongoing clinical support this week, starting at $599 per month to eligible cash-paying patients with a prescription.  The medication will cost Hims & Hers customers more since it comes with added access to care, the company's CEO, Andrew Dudum, told CNBC in an interview. He said he thinks the company's partnership with Novo Nordisk will serve as a case study for how patients get access to and get prices for \"great medicine\" and other forms of treatment.  Ro opted for the lower price, announcing Tuesday it will offer access to all doses of Wegovy for $499 per month. The company provides 24/7 messaging, one-on-one coaching, educational content and more through its monthly membership called the Body Program, which does not include the cost of medication. \"Adding Novo Nordisk's FDA-approved treatments at the best available cash price will help more patients nationwide get the obesity care they need to achieve their goals, particularly those without insurance coverage,\" Ro CEO Zach Reitano said in a release. Earlier this month, Hims & Hers   that patients could access  's weight loss medication   and diabetes drug  , as well as the generic injection liraglutide, through its platform. But unlike the company's collaboration with Novo Nordisk,   released a statement clarifying that it has \"no affiliation\" with Hims & Hers. Hims & Hers started prescribing compounded semaglutide, the active ingredient in  's diabetes drug Ozempic and Wegovy, in May of 2024. The company has largely had to stop offering the compounded medications en masse, but some consumers may still be able to access personalized doses if it's clinically applicable, Dudum said.  \"That was one of the first things we shared with Novo is that we will always fight on behalf of what consumers we believe have the right to get,\" Dudum said. \"The regulation is very clear.\"  During  , pharmacists can legally make compounded versions of brand-name medications. They can also be produced on a case-by-case basis when it's medically necessary for a patient, such as when they can't swallow a pill or are allergic to a specific ingredient in a branded drug.  But drugmakers and some health experts have pushed back against the practice, largely because the FDA does not approve compounded drugs.  Larger, federally regulated compounding pharmacies that make copies of semaglutide in bulk without prescriptions face a legal deadline of May 22 to stop marketing and selling those versions. Smaller, state-licensed compounding pharmacies that manufacture semaglutide copycats for individual prescriptions had a deadline of April 22.   \"The spirit of this is that we stay true to what the rules are,\" Moore said. \"That's the best way for us to serve patients.\"", "summary": null, "related_articles": [], "metadata": {"author": null, "publish_date": "2025-04-29T11:52:16+0000", "read_time": null, "keywords": "Breaking News: Business,Health care industry,Pharmaceuticals,Biotech and Pharmaceuticals,Biotechnology,Business,Novo Nordisk A/S,Hims & Hers Health Inc,Novo Nordisk A/S,business news"}, "category": "Health and Science"}

Twenty-five years later, the company is still serving women, \"a lot of women,\" Strober says. She was a pregnant venture investor at the time she made the BabyCenter investment, and it helped to spark a bigger idea: for too long, she says, the storyline for women facing challenges has been \"just deal with it.\" \"It's a weird thing ... and that's just really unhealthy, and we have to change that,\" Strober said at the recent CNBC Changemakers Summit in Los Angeles. For Chelsea Hirschhorn, having her first child led her to become \"totally disillusioned\" with the chasm between the image of new parenthood that was marketed and the reality she experienced. \"The picture-perfect image of parenting was overwhelming for a new parent,\" she said. \"There was a big dichotomy between the content I was consuming and the front-line experience at 3 a.m.\" Hirschhorn says there was no data available at the time to substantiate what she felt because the topic was understudied and underfunded, so she \"took on\" the category of infant health and wellness. \"For whatever reason,\" Hirschhorn says, she had \"the conviction to think I could fix this.\" While there is a distinction between the health challenges the two female CEO and founders focus on — not every woman will become pregnant but all will go through menopause — one big idea binds the two women leaders together: products, treatments and services exist that can meet critical needs in an underserved, and undervalued, market. \"We have this idea that perimenopause is at a certain time and people think they have to suffer for a really long time before they get the right care, but what we say is you don't have to suffer at all,\" Strober shared at the Changemakers Summit. \"As soon as you're in your 30s and anything starts feeling wrong, you should get help. The idea of suffering is really outdated,\" she said. \"Women have been trained to suffer for far too long.\"  and   were both named to the  . (Actress and entrepreneur  , who has become a leading advocate for menopause health as founder and chief creative officer at Stripes Beauty after struggling with early menopause at the height of her early Hollywood fame, was also among the 2025 Changemakers.) At the Changemakers Summit on April 8, the two women CEOs shared advice and lessons from their successes bringing new business ideas to health care. Here are a few of the key themes they touched on in a discussion with CNBC's Kate Rooney. In addition to \"the dearth of information\" that exists to prepare women for the reality of parenthood, educational content for women has been censored when on topics related to reproductive health. That was something that Hirschhorn learned once she started Frida, a time when it was \"almost impossible,\" she says, to find authentic storytelling on the subject matter, and led her to create  . \"Sixty percent of women's health ads content, or content in general, has been in some way, shape or form, rejected or filtered,\" she said. That's not just online but on linear television, part of what Hirschhorn calls a \"very gendered dichotomy,\" citing the fact that male health and sexual wellness content is approved at a significantly higher rate. That leaves her \"incredulous,\" she said, and it is a call to action to shift from women's health being a topic of provocation to a topic of public health. \"Women have to advocate for themselves,\" she said. \"Women can't be complacent, and this goes beyond health care. This can drive real change, in retail ... in every facet of life,\" she added. Strober noted that when she was building Midi Health it became clear that a major challenge would be working with codes created by the insurance industry for menopause, in effect, another form of institutional censorship. Midi Health decided to position itself as an in-network primary care provider that had a specialty in menopause and that turned out to be a \"really effective\" way to gain traction, she says, and it now has nationwide insurance coverage with all the large insurance companies in the U.S. \"They are not necessarily going to cover sexual health issues but they will cover primary care, so you just subsume it,\" she explained. By viewing menopause as just part of women's health, she says, the company was able to create a reimbursement mechanism that meets insurance standards. That insurance coverage is a very big deal, because research is showing that lack of menopause treatment can have a high cost when it comes to women's careers.   Strober pointed to during the Changemakers discussion found that at the mid-career moment when women should be gaining their greatest successes in the workplace, the shift into menopause can hold them back. Strober said the growing body of research details how menopause can result in discrimination at work, with women quitting jobs, or not going for raises or promotions because of symptoms, and also because they don't believe they can get the treatment that they need. \"If you believe that you have something that can't be fixed, it's very embarrassing, and that means people step back from what they are doing,\" Strober said. \"They are scared,\" she added. That can be the experience that is called brain fog, and also hot flashes. \"You lose power during hot flashes,\" Strober said. \"People are not as confident. But if you are getting treated for it, 'it's just a hot flash' and you can regain power,\" she added. Hirschhorn says that by the numbers, there is still huge potential in the women's health market. It is estimated to grow to $60 billion by 2027, according to data she cited at the event, and that is despite the fact that less than 4% of health-care R&D spending and investment goes to the category — a \"seismic gap,\" she said. It is a well-known fact in consumer research that women dominate household spending, but Hirschhorn said in Frida's market there is a \"viral\" opportunity that is underappreciated. \"Creating products for women based on real need creates a virality that is hard to recreate with other demographics,\" she said. \"These women aren't just buying their products, they are selling them to their communities and friends. We call that 'word of mom,\" Hirschhorn said. \"It's a really big untapped opportunity,\" she added. As a former venture investor, Strober said it is important to accept that \"people are not dying to invest in women's health,\" but she added that when you can show the growth that companies like Midi Health are posting, that won't slow a company down. \"We are the fastest-growing digital health company, probably ever, quite honestly,\" she said. \"We are growing insanely fast because women really need access to this care and can't get it elsewhere,\" she added. Similar to the \"virality\" experienced by Frida, Strober says the business model does build on itself. \"Once you take care of one thing for women they come back to you for something else, and if you develop this trusted platform for them, where they become your long-term patient, that is a good business,\" she said. \"We don't say it's a women's business, we say it's a really good business,\" she added. That opportunity and the unfiltered realities of parenthood have now grown Frida to more than 150 products, covering everything from conception to post-partum and breastfeeding care, and beyond. \"My four children are a hotbed of inspiration and my 'snot sucking' days are almost over,\" Hirschhorn said. But she added, \"The same problems exist, you just need a different toolkit.\" At Midi Health, Strober says the next big opportunity to unlock is making connections between menopause health and longevity. \"If you take care of yourself in your 40s you can really prevent a lot of the diseases that come in your 80s, and so we have been thinking a lot about this longevity market,\" Strober said. \"It's all bros, all the bros who are out there and talking about wanting to live to 150. We just want to take care of ourselves. We don't care about living to 150. We just want to be healthy grandmas,\" she said. \"What do we do, how do we take care of our brains and bones and hearts to age in a healthy way?\" Strober asks. She says there are many treatments, products and services yet to be developed by health companies that will help women in their 40s, 50s and 60s to better answer that question.", "summary": null, "related_articles": [], "metadata": {"author": null, "publish_date": "2025-04-29T19:23:50+0000", "read_time": null, "keywords": "Menopause,Health,Gender issues,Health care industry,Health insurance,Suppress Zephr,Social issues,business news"}, "category": "Health and Science"}

For many, the big question is whether the pricey medications known as GLP-1s will pay off by improving worker health and lowering overall health costs over time. Analysts at Aon say it's already happening.   \"We've never seen anything like this, really,\" said Greg Case, CEO of  , an employer benefits services firm. \"There was a 44% reduction in major cardiovascular issues.

Aon analysts looked at medical claims data for 139,000 U.S.-based workers with employer health coverage who took GLP-1 medications between 2022 and 2024. Beyond the drug costs, the study found GLP-1 patients tend to incur higher medical costs in their first year on the drugs, with more doctor visits to monitor their treatment on the drug and to seek help for other issues such as sleep apnea and esophageal conditions like acid reflux. \"The increase comes about in the first 12 to 15 months,\" Case said. \"They're getting remedies on things that actually are underlying conditions [of obesity].\" But by the end of the second year of treatment with the GLP-1 drugs, the medical cost trend for patients taking them slowed by 7% on average, compared to workers with similar chronic conditions and obesity characteristics who were not taking the drugs, Aon found. For those not taking the drug, the medical cost trend was 14%. The biggest driver of those savings was the reduction by more than 40% of major adverse cardiac events such as heart attacks and strokes, compared with patients who were not taking the drugs, as well as a reduction in the onset of diabetes.  Case said with this data, Aon has been able to help clients understand the timeline for seeing a return on providing insurance coverage for GLP-1s for weight loss, in addition to Type 2 diabetes. \"We saw every single place where the cost went down — and it's stunning,\" said Case. \"You can do this in a way that has an ROI, that will literally be an economic return.\" Following its research, Aon has launched a subsidized GLP-1 weight management program for its own U.S. workforce, which includes weekly virtual wellness visits and home blood tests to help employees adhere to the drug regimen.

Kennedy Jr.'s   of the Department of Health and Human Services involves deep cuts to several divisions that help protect and improve the health of minority and underserved populations and eliminate health disparities in the U.S., CNBC has learned. Kennedy, the Health and Human Services secretary, has gutted at least seven minority health offices across the department, according to people familiar with the matter, who requested anonymity to speak freely. HHS has laid off a significant share of workers at those offices, or in some cases all of them, along with their directors, the people said. The affected units include the HHS Office of Minority Health and the National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities, or  . The cuts also hit offices with similar functions at the Food and Drug Administration, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, the Health Resources and Services Administration, and the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, according to the people.  Health policy experts told CNBC that deep cuts to those divisions could widen existing health disparities in the U.S., undoing years of progress toward addressing them. Over time, that could worsen health outcomes for already underserved groups, threaten overall public health, strain the U.S. health-care system and drive up health-care costs.  \"It will have negative health impacts, obviously, for groups that they're focused on, so racial and ethnic minorities, but I think what gets missed in the story is it ultimately impacts all of us, no matter what your background is,\" Dr. Stephanie Ettinger De Cuba, research professor of health law, policy and management at Boston University, told CNBC.  \"It's not a zero-sum game. So I think that's what is deeply disturbing to me, as we are going to see people get hurt,\" she said. \"Decimating or cutting staff from these offices ultimately makes it worse for everyone.\" The Trump administration can't shutter the affected offices entirely, which would   since they were authorized by the Affordable Care Act more than a decade ago, the people said. The exact fate of each office and the NIH institute is unclear, they added.  The administration likely hopes to at least \"narrow the scope\" of what NIMHD and the agency offices do, curtailing their authority and limiting resources, said Brandyn Churchill, professor of public administration and policy at American University.  The cuts come as health disparities remain a major challenge in the U.S., affecting not only people of color but also rural residents, low-income communities and individuals with disabilities, among several other groups. These communities often face worse health outcomes – such as lower life expectancy and higher rates of infant mortality and chronic disease – and more limited access to care and other resources than the U.S. population as a whole.  The Covid-19 pandemic deepened many of these gaps, highlighting how the long U.S. history of exclusionary policies and systemic issues such as poverty and racism contribute to unequal health outcomes across the country.  Health policy experts stress that addressing those disparities leads to stronger overall public health, as healthier communities improve outcomes for everyone. It could also relieve a huge economic burden on the U.S: a   found that racial and ethnic health disparities cost the U.S. economy $451 billion in 2018.   Kennedy is consolidating divisions and slashing 10,000 jobs at HHS,   that oversees vaccines and other medicines, scientific research, public health infrastructure, pandemic preparedness, and food and tobacco products. HHS also manages government-funded health care for millions of Americans – including seniors, disabled people and lower-income patients who rely on Medicare, Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act's markets. Kennedy plans to create a new HHS agency called the Administration for a Healthy America, which will combine several existing offices. That includes HRSA, SAMHSA, the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Health, the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry, and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health. A leaked 64-page preliminary budget document also indicates that the HHS Office of Minority Health would fall under that new agency, according to several reports. But that proposal, which would slash the HHS budget by a third, or roughly $40 billion, requires congressional approval.  HHS did not immediately respond to a request for comment. While the breadth of the cutbacks varied at agencies within HHS, the minority health agencies across the departments will now be only a fraction of their former size. All 40 staff members at the CMS Office of Minority Health were laid off, according to the people. CMS plans to appoint a new director for that unit, but the current director has not resigned from the role, CNBC previously  .  The office works with local and federal partners to eliminate disparities in health coverage, aiming to ensure that minority and underserved populations can access Medicare, Medicaid and Affordable Care Act marketplace plans. It also conducts research and analysis to help lower costs and reduce the incidence and severity of chronic diseases in the U.S.  Nearly all staff at the CDC's Office of Minority Health were cut, according to the people. To adhere to the letter of the law, the Trump administration is considering reconstituting that unit and the Office of Women's Health so that each office would be made up of at least one director or a very small group of employees, the people said.  The agency's Office of Minority Health works across CDC to promote research of health disparities and create programs to improve the health of racial and ethnic minority groups. At the FDA's Office of Minority Health and Health Equity, all staff were cut, the people said. The future of that office is unclear.  The unit focuses on efforts such as increasing clinical trial diversity, improving transparency around how medical products affect different populations, and creating health resources tailored to a range of languages and cultures. No staff are left at HRSA's Office of Health Equity after the layoffs, as well as some retirements and reassignments, according to the people. That office leads efforts to reduce disparities in health-care access, quality and outcomes through HRSA, which focuses on people who are uninsured, geographically isolated, or economically and medically vulnerable. The future of that office is also unclear, apart from the Trump administration's plans to fold HRSA into Kennedy's new agency. The same goes for SAMHSA's , which saw all remaining staff cut except for a new, recently hired director, according to the people. The office also had a retirement and one worker on probation who was put on administrative leave.  The office works to ensure that SAMHSA's resources for mental health and substance abuse treatment, including grant programs and other initiatives, are equitably distributed across all communities and populations. Roughly a third of staff are gone at NIMHD, some of whom were laid off and others who left due to early retirements and buyouts, the people said. Some workers on probation were put on leave several weeks before Kennedy started cuts, they said.  The institute's deputy director accepted an offer to be acting director in the short term, the people added. NIMHD, which is part of the National Institutes of Health, works to reduce health disparities through conducting and funding research and developing new programs. The HHS Office of Minority Health also faced cuts, though it's unclear how many staff were impacted, the people said. That office leads the federal effort to improve health outcomes for racial and ethnic minority groups, developing policies and programs and providing funding. It will likely take several months to a year before the U.S. sees direct consequences from the cuts to NIMHD and the offices, said Terry McGovern, professor at the CUNY Graduate School of Public Health and Health Policy. But the staff reductions could cause the U.S. to lose out on crucial data, which is the cornerstone for addressing health disparities, according to Samantha Artiga, director for the racial equity and health policy program at KFF, a health policy research organization.  Artiga said data and research are essential for pinpointing where disparities exist, understanding their root causes, crafting effective solutions, and tracking progress over time. For example, data can reveal whether certain groups experience worse surgical outcomes or wait longer at the emergency room, or if a vaccination program is being equitably distributed across regions. \"Without focused data and research, those disparities may remain unseen and unaddressed, creating blind spots,\" Artiga said, adding that the U.S. would eventually have to rebuild that knowledge in the future.  The fate of many of the grants that NIMHD and some of the offices provide is unclear. That includes  from HHS' Office of Minority Health to 20 organizations for a four-year initiative to identify strategies that increase the use of preventive health services in communities.  But if offices cut back that funding or stop it altogether, it could also weaken the nation's ability to reduce health disparities, Boston University's Ettinger De Cuba said.  Community-based organizations rely on federal money to deliver culturally tailored care to different groups, and could be forced to scale back or shut down programs. The loss of grants could also stall research, innovation and public health interventions by outside entities, such as universities, health-care systems and social service organizations.  \"Philanthropy is not able to step up at this level long term. The only actor that's able to do that is the government,\" Ettinger De Cuba said.  Nathan Boucher, research professor at Duke's Sanford School of Public Policy, added that the cuts will \"degrade any effort of these larger governmental organizations to have any accountability when it comes to protecting the people they help and serve every day.\"  While Kennedy has said his cuts are focused on making HHS more \"responsive and efficient,\" Boucher said targeting minority health offices could do the opposite.  \"I actually think it's an efficiency argument to be able to have these minority health offices, because it allows you to identify and target some real problem areas and use taxpayer dollars in the most efficient way possible,\" said Boucher. ", "summary": null, "related_articles": [], "metadata": {"author": null, "publish_date": "2025-04-30T16:42:17+0000", "read_time": null, "keywords": "Breaking News: Politics,Business,Biotechnology,Biotech and Pharmaceuticals,Pharmaceuticals,Health care industry,Breaking News: Business,Politics,business news"}, "category": "Health and Science"}

Still, it could elevate production costs and drug prices, raising affordability concerns, GlobalData said.  Here's a list of the companies that have announced new U.S. investments since Trump took office:  Other companies, such as  , also announced U.S. investments last year.  Meanwhile, Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla on Tuesday said uncertainty around pharmaceutical tariffs is deterring the company from further investing in U.S. manufacturing and research and development.  \"If I know that there will not be tariffs ... then there are tremendous investments that can happen in this country, both in R&D and manufacturing,\" Bourla said on the call, adding that the company is also hoping for \"certainty.\" Feel free to send any tips, suggestions, story ideas and data to Annika at  .  on Tuesday announced that data from its Libre continuous glucose monitoring systems will integrate directly with Epic Systems' electronic health record (EHR) software in the U.S.  A continuous glucose monitor, or a CGM, is a small sensor that pokes through the skin and sends real-time glucose readings to an app. Glucose is a type of sugar people get from food, and it's people's main energy source. Managing glucose is crucial for patients with diabetes to   serious health problems, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  Abbott's integration with Epic will allow doctors to view their patients' glucose data before, during and after visits, and it's meant to help them access the information in a simple and actionable way. Abbott is working with Epic's Aura software, which connects health systems with medical device manufacturers and diagnostics labs, according to a release.  Abbott said there's more to come.  \"While the integration with Libre data is Abbott's first medical device offering with Epic, it's just the beginning,\" Lisa Earnhardt, executive vice president of medical devices for Abbott, said in a release. \"We aim to expand this model to our other medical devices and connected care platforms in the future.\" Abbott sells a range of CGM systems, and it's the market leader in the space based on number of users, according to a 2024 market model from the firm William Blair.  Dexcom, a competing CGM company, is the second largest player behind Abbott, according to William Blair. Dexcom also offers its own direct EHR integration solution, which is available to customers using Epic's software.

The company now expects full-year adjusted earnings of $6 to $6.20 per share, up from a previous guidance of $5.75 to $6 per share But the company revised its GAAP diluted EPS guidance to be lower, which includes charges related to a legal battle involving its pharmacy services provider subsidiary, Omnicare. A jury this week found Omnicare liable for dispensing drugs without valid prescriptions to elderly and disabled individuals in assisted living and long-term care facilities. CVS plans to appeal. The company did not provide a revenue forecast for the year. CVS said it is \"maintaining a cautious view for the remainder of the year\" in light of continued higher medical costs and \"the potential for macro headwinds.\" \"We got smarter about the markets that we wanted and the lives that we wanted to compete for, and so we actually have planned and budgeted for the elevated trends,\" CVS CEO David Joyner said in an interview with CNBC, referring to markets that the insurance unit operates in and higher medical costs \"So I think why you're not seeing a surprise on our part is because we actually plan for elevated trends going into this year,\" he added. Joyner said the company is watching for the potential impact from President  s planned tariffs on pharmaceuticals imported into the U.S. \"On the pharmacy side, I think it is highly dependent on what happens in the next week or two when they announce the implications of tariffs on the manufacturers,\" he told CNBC. Joyner added that the vast majority of the company's retail products at the front of stores are sourced in the U.S., \"which should be a benefit for us.\" Here's what CVS reported for the first quarter compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:  The company's insurer, Aetna, and its rivals have been dogged by higher-than-expected medical costs over the last year as more Medicare Advantage patients return to hospitals for procedures they delayed during the pandemic. But for the first time in several quarters, CVS' insurance business appeared to show some signs of improvement. The unit's medical benefit ratio — a measure of total medical expenses paid relative to premiums collected — decreased to 87.3% from 90.4% a year earlier. A lower ratio typically indicates that a company collected more in premiums than it paid out in benefits, resulting in higher profitability. CVS said the move partly reflects stronger underlying performance in its Medicare business and improved Medicare Advantage star ratings for the 2025 payment year. Those ratings help patients compare the quality of Medicare health and drug plans. \"I think that investment and talent that allowed us to focus on both the execution and the operation … actually helped establish the performance that you're seeing,\" Joyner said, referring to an executive reshuffling last year that tapped a new leader for the insurance unit and other parts of the business. The results cap off the second full quarter with  , a longtime CVS executive, as chief executive of the retail drugstore chain. Joyner succeeded Karen Lynch in mid-October, as CVS struggled to drive higher profits and improve its stock performance. The company underwent a management reshuffle as part of a broader turnaround plan that includes   in cost cuts over the next several years. Still, CVS' performance was partially offset by a charge of $431 million from so-called premium deficiency reserves in the insurance unit, which is related to anticipated losses in the 2025 coverage year. That refers to a liability that an insurer may need to cover if future premiums are not enough to pay for anticipated claims and expenses. The company posted net income of $1.78 billion, or $1.41 per share, for the first quarter. That compares with net income of $1.12 billion, or 88 cents per share, for the year-earlier period.  Excluding certain items, such as amortization of intangible assets, restructuring charges and capital losses, adjusted earnings were $2.25 per share for the quarter. CVS booked sales of $94.59 billion for the first quarter, up 7% from the same period a year ago due to growth across all three of its business segments.  But sales in the company's retail pharmacy segment missed Wall Street's expectations for the quarter, according to StreetAccount. That business has been pressured by softer consumer spending and lower reimbursements for prescription drugs.  CVS' insurance business booked $34.81 billion in revenue during the quarter, up 8% from the first quarter of 2024. Analysts expected the unit to take in $33.51 billion for the period, according to estimates from StreetAccount. The unit also recorded adjusted operating income of $1.99 billion for the first quarter, compared with $732 million for the year-earlier period.  Also on Thursday, CVS said Aetna will stop offering health insurance plans on the Affordable Care Act marketplaces — also known as individual exchanges — starting in the 2026 plan year. CVS' pharmacy and consumer wellness division booked $31.91 billion in sales for the first quarter, up more than 11% from the same period a year earlier. But that was far under the $35.27 billion that analysts were expecting for the quarter, according to StreetAccount. That unit dispenses prescriptions in CVS' more than 9,000 retail pharmacies and provides other pharmacy services, such as vaccinations and diagnostic testing. CVS' health services segment generated $43.46 billion in revenue for the quarter, up nearly 8% compared with the same quarter in 2024. Analysts expected the unit to post $43.64 billion in sales for the period, according to StreetAccount. That unit includes Caremark, one of the nation's largest pharmacy benefit managers.

But Caremark's clients, which are employers and unions, \"individually determine how much of that savings on Wegovy gets shared with its members either via lower premiums or lower copays at the pharmacy counter,\" the spokesperson said.  Separately, any patient who does not have insurance coverage for Wegovy or another GLP-1 can still buy Novo Nordisk's drug out-of-pocket for $499 at any of CVS' 9,000 pharmacies nationwide, the spokesperson added.  In its earnings release, CVS said it is the first retail pharmacy partnering with Novo Nordisk's new direct-to-consumer online pharmacy,  , to dispense Wegovy to patients with prescriptions. NovoCare offers Wegovy at that lower price point to cash-paying patients, who may struggle to shoulder the drug's roughly $1,000 list price before insurance and other rebates. Caremark will also combine Wegovy with additional lifestyle support, such as personalized nutrition plans, as part of the CVS Weight Management program. The announcement comes as the Danish drugmaker races to capture more patients now that many compounding pharmacies are legally restricted from making cheaper, unapproved versions of Wegovy, with rare exceptions. \"It's unknown at this point how the migration from the compound pharmacies into other pharmacy settings are going to occur,\" CVS Health group president Prem Shah said on an earnings call on Thursday. \"But we do expect that there will be obviously some benefit by opening up 9,000 stores, or 9,000 opportunities for patients to be able to get the medication.\" Dave Moore, Novo Nordisk's executive vice president of U.S. operations, said in a separate release on Thursday that \"it is our responsibility to continue to work with others across the US healthcare system to find innovative opportunities to meet the needs of these patients and connect them with authentic, FDA-approved Wegovy … in a convenient and affordable way.\"", "summary": null, "related_articles": [], "metadata": {"author": null, "publish_date": "2025-05-01T10:31:30+0000", "read_time": null, "keywords": "Breaking News: Business,Health care industry,Pharmaceuticals,Biotech and Pharmaceuticals,Biotechnology,Business,CVS Health Corp,Novo Nordisk A/S,Novo Nordisk A/S,LILLY DRN,business news"}, "category": "Health and Science"}

The pharmaceutical giant now expects its adjusted fiscal 2025 earnings to come in between $20.78 and $22.28 per share, down from previous guidance of $22.50 to $24 per share. Eli Lilly said the revision reflects a $1.57 billion deal charge recorded in the first quarter, which is primarily related to its acquisition of a certain oral cancer drug from Scorpion Therapeutics. The company maintained its fiscal 2025 sales guidance of $58 billion to $61 billion. Eli Lilly said the guidance reflects President  's existing tariffs as of May 1, but does not include his planned levies on pharmaceuticals imported into the U.S. In an interview with CNBC, Eli Lilly CEO Dave Ricks said the company and other drugmakers are already announcing  , which is one of the Trump administration's stated goals of the tariffs. \"I think that actually the threat of tariffs is already bringing back critical supply chains into important industries, chips and pharma,\" Ricks said. \"So do we need to enact [tariffs?] I'm not so sure.\" He added that Eli Lilly wants to see permanently lower tax rates in the U.S., particularly 15% for domestic production. Ricks said lower taxes drove many drugmakers to manufacture in \"low-tax islands like Ireland Singapore and in Switzerland, and that can come back if there's an economic incentive.\" Eli Lilly's blockbuster diabetes treatment Mounjaro topped expectations for the first quarter, raking in $3.84 billion in revenue. That's up a whopping 113% from the same period a year ago. The company's weight loss drug Zepbound also beat estimates, booking $2.31 billion in sales for the quarter. That more than quadrupled the $517.4 million that the treatment brought in a year ago, when it had just entered the U.S. market. Analysts expected Mounjaro and Zepbound to generate $3.81 billion and $2.28 billion in sales, respectively, according to estimates from StreetAccount. Shares of Eli Lilly closed more than 11% on Thursday. That came after   on Thursday said its pharmacy benefit manager would make   Wegovy the preferred weight loss medication on its main formularies instead of Zepbound. Here's what Eli Lilly reported for the first quarter compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:  The company posted first-quarter revenue of $12.73 billion, up 45% from the same period a year ago.  Sales in the U.S. jumped 49% to $8.49 billion. Eli Lilly said that was driven by a 57% increase in volume – or the number of prescriptions or units sold – for Zepbound and Mounjaro. That was partially offset by lower realized prices of the drugs, the company said. The pharmaceutical giant booked net income of $2.76 billion, or $3.06 per share, for the first quarter. That compares with net income of $2.24 billion, or $2.48 share, a year earlier.  Excluding one-time items associated with the value of intangible assets and other adjustments, Eli Lilly posted earnings of $3.34 per share for the first quarter. Demand in the U.S. has still far outpaced supply of Zepbound and Mounjaro over the last year. Both so-called incretin treatments mimic certain gut hormones to tamp down a person's appetite and regulate their blood sugar. The popularity of those injectable drugs has forced both Eli Lilly and its rival   to invest billions to ramp up manufacturing capacity for their treatments. The efforts appear to be paying off: The Food and Drug Administration in December   to declare the U.S. shortage of tirzepatide — the active ingredient in Zepbound and Mounjaro — over.

He spoke after Eli Lilly  , which did not include estimated effects of the potential pharmaceutical tariffs. He said national security concerns around those medications are \"valid.\" But he added: \"Do I think tariffs are the answer to that? I'm not so sure personally.\" \"We would be happy to talk to this administration or national security people about how we could respond to such a crisis,\" he said. \"We have capacities to bring to bear there, and we're happy to help the country if we're in need.\" Older generic drugs account for about  prescribed in the U.S. Many are critical for hospital care, including antibiotics and vasopressors, or medications that raise blood pressure.  Ricks noted that those essential drugs are \"not easy to make, but they're cheap, and they've been driven out of our country due to cost and other damaging policies.\" However, some health experts previously told CNBC that tariffs on generic drugs, which have far lower profit margins than branded medications, could force some generic drugmakers to leave the U.S. market altogether. That could lead to or exacerbate shortages of certain generic drugs in the U.S., such as sterile injectable drugs commonly used in hospitals. Rick's comments come as drugmakers brace for President  's planned pharmaceutical tariffs, which aim to boost domestic manufacturing. Those tariff threats are already   of U.S. manufacturing investments from the pharmaceutical industry.

References to the insect were abundant at the company's old headquarters in London, where a picture of a cockroach was prominently displayed on the wall. For much of Hinge's 10-year history, the cockroach was the unofficial mascot. Staffers named it Flossy after the viral dance move \"the floss.\" Perez relishes the symbolism. In his determination to build a company that will push through adversity, he's encouraged employees to think of themselves like cockroaches, due to the creature's grimy resilience and noted ability to survive harsh conditions. \"It was the identity of every individual in the company,\" said Joshua Sturm, a vice president at Hinge from 2019 to 2024 and now chief revenue officer at cancer prevention startup Color Health. \"We are all in this together, and no matter what happens, we are going to survive together.\" Perez and his 1,400-person workforce now face the ultimate test of their mettle. Hinge, which moved from London to San Francisco in 2017, is trying to go public at a time of such extreme economic uncertainty and market volatility that several companies, including online lender   and ticket marketplace  , have delayed their long-awaited IPOs. Hinge filed its prospectus  , announcing plans to trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol \"HNGE.\" Three weeks later,   announced a sweeping tariff policy that plunged U.S. markets into turmoil after tariff concerns had already pushed the Nasdaq to its worst quarter since 2022. But Hinge, led by its 39-year-old co-founder and CEO, appears determined to power through the chaos. Hinge declined to comment or make Perez available for an interview.  Going public was already going to be a risky endeavor for Hinge. The IPO market has been   since late 2021, when soaring inflation and rising interest rates pushed investors out of risky assets. Within digital health, it's been almost completely dead. Health-tech companies have struggled to adapt to a more muted growth environment following the Covid pandemic, and many once promising business models haven't panned out as planned. The starkest example is virtual health company  , which has a market cap of just over $1 billion less than five years after buying digital health provider Livongo in a deal that valued the   at $37 billion. Teladoc's BetterHelp mental health unit has been a particularly troublesome business as paying users dropped off in the years following the pandemic. Over time, Hinge's Cockroach Award transitioned from a monthly prize to a quarterly distinction. The company phased it out entirely about a year ago in preparation for its next public-facing chapter, but the survive-at-all-costs mentality persists, according to current employees. Now, staffers are recognized with the \"Movers Awards,\" a nod to the company's focus on movement. \"We have many decades of work ahead,\" Perez wrote in a letter to investors in March. \"We hope you join us on this journey.\" CNBC spoke to 13 current and former Hinge employees, investors, and people close to Perez for this story, some of whom asked not to be named in order to provide candid commentary. Hinge uses software to help patients treat acute musculoskeletal injuries, chronic pain and carry out post-surgery rehabilitation remotely. Large employers like   and   cover the costs so their employees can access Hinge's app-based virtual physical therapy, as well as its wearable electrical nerve stimulation device called Enso.  The company   its technology can help users manage pain, cut down health-care costs and reduce the need for surgery and opioids. Revenue increased 33% to $390.4 million last year, while its net loss narrowed to $11.9 million from $108.1 million a year earlier, according to the prospectus. Hinge's roster of clients expanded by 36% last year to 2,256, and the number of individual members jumped 44% to over 532,300, the filing said. In an   on Monday, Hinge   revenue in its first quarter climbed 50% to $123.8 million, up from $82.7 million during the same period last year, and that net income for the period was $17.1 million compared to a loss of $26.5 million a year ago.  Hinge has raised more than $1 billion from investors including Tiger Global Management and Coatue Management, and it boasted a   as of October 2021, the last time the company raised outside funding. The biggest institutional shareholders are venture firms Insight Partners and Atomico, which own 19% and 15% of the stock, respectively, according to the filing. Perez and Gabriel Mecklenburg, Hinge's executive chairman, started the company in 2014. The pair met while they were both pursuing PhDs in the U.K. — Perez at the University of Oxford and Mecklenburg at Imperial College London. They were distracted students, according to Perez's twin brother, David.  By the time they launched Hinge, Perez and Mecklenburg had already co-founded two other ventures together. One was the Oxbridge Biotech Roundtable, an organization that connected academics and industry experts. The other was Marblar, which worked to commercialize academic intellectual property. Perez took a leave of absence from Oxford while working on Marblar and never returned. His brother wasn't a fan of the decision initially. \"I gave him terrible advice,\" said David Perez, a graduate of Yale Law School and partner at Perkins Coie in Seattle. \"I was like, 'I think you're an idiot, I think you should focus on your PhD. Only an idiot would not finish a PhD at Oxford.'\"  The twins have two older siblings. Their mother immigrated from Cuba in 1968, followed 12 years later by their father. Their parents met in Miami, got married after just three dates, and are still together after more than 40 years.  The family moved from Miami to Salt Lake City, Utah, in 1990. Perez's mother was a substitute teacher and his father worked at restaurants as a dishwasher and busboy. David Perez said their father \"worked around the clock\" and used to call out orders in his sleep.  \"It wasn't a lot of money, I think combined they made about $19,000 a year,\" David Perez said. \"But they stitched it together and raised four kids.\"  The twin boys were competitive, particularly when it came to academics and playing basketball in the driveway. David said his brother got \"great grades\" and always had an inclination toward science and medicine, graduating from high school at age 16 and then starting college at Westminster University, a small liberal arts school in Utah. \"I swear,\" David Perez said, \"there were times where the only punishment that my mom could issue that would have the sting was restricting our ability to do homework.\" Perez was a student in the Honors College at Westminster, and he graduated with a degree in biology. Richard Badenhausen, dean of the Honors College, described Perez as an independent thinker and an ambitious student, especially for his age.  \"He didn't care too much what people thought about him, which is a strength in my book,\" Badenhausen said in an interview.  When Perez was 13, he was hit by a car. He broke an arm and a leg, and had to be airlifted to a nearby hospital. After three surgeries and 12 months of rehab, he had a newfound interest in orthopedics and physical therapy.  Mecklenburg had a serious injury of his own, tearing his anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) during a judo match, which also required a year of rehab, according to Hinge's website. One day in October 2014  the pair put their heads together and outlined the tools they wished were available while undergoing physical therapy. Musculoskeletal conditions affect as many as 1.7 billion people worldwide, according to Hinge's prospectus, so there was no shortage of opportunities. They had the early concept of Hinge within hours and a prototype ready by December of that year. In Hinge's early days, Perez and Mecklenburg would meet every Saturday morning to talk shop. Now, as they've aged and started families, they meet on Wednesday nights, according to colleagues. Perez welcomed his first child with his wife late last year.  \"Seeing the growth over the last six, seven, eight years has just been unbelievable,\" said Jon Reynolds, a tech founder who contributed to Hinge's seed funding round. \"That comes down to the quality of Dan and Gabriel as leaders. They complement each other really well, and they've obviously got that mutual respect.\" Perez is a hands-on CEO who expects a lot from his staff.  He's direct, detail-oriented, opinionated, competitive and can be intense, according to current and former employees. But he's committed to the mission and the wellbeing of his employees, they said. \"He's one of those rare founder CEOs who I think can go all the way,\" said Paul Kruszewski, a former Hinge employee who joined the company after it acquired his Canadian computer vision startup, Wrnch, in 2021.  Employees say Perez is a voracious reader, often finishing two to four books a month. That includes books about business and leadership, an important source of information given that Hinge was his first real job. He's a fan of \"The Innovator's Prescription,\" by   and others, \"Crossing the Chasm,\" by Geoffrey Moore and \"The Long Fix,\" by Dr. Vivian Lee. He also likes his staffers to read. Executives will often prepare to discuss chapters from a book in their meetings.  \"I'd come home and there'd be a package from Dan, and it's a book,\" said Sturm, who led partnerships and new market development at Hinge. \"That was just the norm.\" Sturm, who has worked in the health-care and benefits space for around 30 years, said Hinge was very deliberate with hiring, so there wasn't a lot of turnover among senior executives. He said Hinge's recruitment process was the hardest he's ever experienced.  Another \"Dan-ism,\" as Sturm called it, is Hinge's philosophy around writing. Perez has employees write memos, typically up to six pages long, instead of preparing slide decks or other materials ahead of meetings. Perez was inspired by a similar practice at  , according to current and former employees, and sees it as a way to force employees to think through what they want to say instead of hiding behind bullet points. Hinge's memo culture can be an adjustment, particularly for new employees. Sturm said he thought the practice was \"insane\" at first, but ultimately came to appreciate it and said it improved his pitches. \"When you sort of sit back, you go, 'You know actually, he wasn't wrong,'\" Sturm said.  Hinge has come a long way since venture firm Atomico led the $8 million Series A investment in 2017. The London-based firm said in a   at the time that it was \"extremely impressed by Daniel and Gabriel, and their determination to tackle a big problem in society.\" Carolina Brochado led the round, though she left Atomico a year later and now works at investment firm EQT Group. She said that getting Hinge to the brink of an IPO was a \"one in a million chance,\" but noted that the company has managed to build a sizable business in digital health despite having so many odds stacked against it. \"Lots of learnings along the way, of course, like a big tech correction in the middle,\" Brochado said in an interview. \"But it really is one of those rare examples of just an enormous market that was under penetrated.\" For David Perez, whose firm now serves as Hinge's outside counsel, watching the startup grow has been \"fascinating,\" he said. \"I'm a partner at a major law firm,\" he said, \"and I am only the second most successful twin. But I think I'm okay with that.\"  ", "summary": null, "related_articles": [], "metadata": {"author": null, "publish_date": "2025-05-05T12:00:01+0000", "read_time": null, "keywords": "IPO,Teladoc Health Inc,Amazon.com Inc,Breaking News: Technology,Technology,Internet,Health care industry,Venture capital,Target Corp,Morgan Stanley,Donald J.

The company partners with existing imaging facilities across more than 70 locations in the U.S., according to its website.  Full-body MRI scans have surged in popularity in recent years after celebrities like Kim Kardashian began posting about them on social media.

It also directs the agency to raise inspection fees for foreign manufacturing plants, improve the enforcement of active-ingredient source reporting by overseas producers and consider publicly listing facilities that don't comply. The White House estimates that it can currently take five to 10 years to build new manufacturing capacity for pharmaceuticals, which it called \"unacceptable from a national-security standpoint.\"  \"We don't want to be buying our pharmaceuticals from other countries because if we're in a war, we're in a problem, we want to be able to make our own,\" Trump said in the fact sheet. \"As we invest in the future, we will permanently bring our medical supply chains back home. We will produce our medical supplies, pharmaceuticals, and treatments right here in the United States.\" The order will allow the FDA to conduct more inspections of new manufacturing sites with the same resources, the agency's commissioner, Marty Makary, told reporters on Monday. The FDA will also ramp up inspections of foreign drug facilities, switching from announced to \"surprise\" visits overseas, he said. \"We had this crazy system in the United States where American pharma manufacturers ... are put through the ringer with inspections, and the foreign sites get a lot easier with scheduled visits, while we have surprise visits,\" Makary said. Trump's order also directs the Environmental Protection Agency to \"accelerate the construction of facilities\" related to manufacturing drugs and their ingredients. And, it ensures that federal agencies issuing permits for a domestic pharmaceutical manufacturing facility designate a single point-of-contact to coordinate applications, along with support from the White House Office of Management and Budget. The order comes ahead of Trump's planned tariffs on pharmaceuticals imported into the U.S. Those potential levies – and efforts to build goodwill with the President – have already   from drugmakers such as  ,   and  .  Trump on Monday told reporters he will announce pharmaceutical-specific tariffs within the next two weeks.

Caremark negotiated an undisclosed lower net price for Wegovy over Zepbound on its standard formularies, offering savings on Novo Nordisk's drug to clients that opt into those plans.  But employers and unions will ultimately determine how much of those savings on Wegovy get shared with members, CVS said.  Wegovy's list price before insurance is $1,349 for a month's supply, while Zepbound's is $1,086. That decision by one of the nation's largest PBMs triggered fears of a price war in the weight loss drug market and concerns that Zepbound's sales momentum could stall. Shares of Eli Lilly plunged 11% on Thursday.  But several Wall Street analysts said the selloff was overblown. \"In our view, the Novo/CVS deal does not represent the beginning of an obesity pricing war between Lilly & Novo,\" BMO Capital Markets analyst Evan Seigerman said in a note on Thursday. He added that in discussions with the companies, both Lilly and Novo emphasized they want to expand patient access – not undercut each other on price. That may be reassuring to investors worried that a price war could hurt profit margins. But the high list price of those weight loss drugs may remain a major barrier for many patients, particularly those whose health plans don't cover the medications.  Eli Lilly told the firm it is not interested in exclusive \"one-of-one\" deals with PBMs, while Novo Nordisk said CVS approached the drugmaker about the Wegovy agreement, according to Seigerman. On an earnings call on Thursday, Eli Lilly CEO David Ricks said the company has been trying to move away from setting high list prices and paying bigger rebates to PBMs for preferential coverage. Instead, Eli Lilly is trying to set list prices closer to what it expects the plans to pay for its drugs. \"We have been very vocal about trying to move away from that,\" Ricks said, referring to deep PBM rebates.  He added that Zepbound is still growing market share.  Seigerman agreed, saying that Eli Lilly is \"continuing to perform where it matters.\" Zepbound and the company's diabetes drug Mounjaro now make up over half of U.S. GLP-1 prescriptions, outpacing the combined 46% share of Novo Nordisk's Wegovy and its diabetes treatment Ozempic, according to Seigerman.  That \"market-share traction clearly demonstrates that physicians and patients prefer Zepbound\" over Wegovy, Bernstein analyst Courtney Breen wrote in a separate note on Thursday.  It's unclear how much the CVS formulary change will appeal to employers, especially given that Zepbound is known to be more effective at promoting weight loss than Wegovy. Some patients on the standard formularies may also try to stay on their current Zepbound prescriptions by requesting exemptions, JPMorgan analyst Chris Schott said in a Thursday note.  Eli Lilly's Ricks also said CVS' move mainly affects smaller employers, who are more likely to stick with Caremark's standard formularies. Larger companies covering more patients often use customized formularies, meaning they can still decide to include Zepbound.  Regardless, the CVS-Wegovy deal overshadowed   for Eli Lilly.  The company's first-quarter revenue and earnings topped estimates on skyrocketing demand for Zepbound and Mounjaro, both of which raked in billions of dollars in sales for the period.  We'll continue to track Eli Lilly's performance in the weight loss drug market, so stay tuned!

Health-care marketplace Zocdoc has launched an artificial intelligence phone assistant that can help patients schedule appointments using conversational language. Zocdoc, founded in 2007, helps connect patients to in-network doctors and book appointments for both in person and virtual care. The company's new AI assistant, called Zo, can handle \"unlimited\" inbound calls at any hour of the day, eliminating hold times, Zocdoc said in a release.  The company said Zo can save staffers time and improve patients' experiences, which can ultimately encourage them to seek out the care they need. The assistant also serves as a major step toward what the company called its goal of aiding scheduling \"everywhere patients are seeking care.\" \"What's most exciting about Zo is that it is powered by nearly two decades of Zocdoc's expertise in facilitating patient-provider interactions, understanding complex healthcare scheduling logic, and integrating with a broad base of [electronic health records],\" Zocdoc CEO Oliver Kharraz said in a statement.  Patients can ask Zo questions like, \"Do you take my insurance?,\" or \"Do you have any offices near the West Village?,\" according to a pre-recorded demo. Health-care organizations can implement Zo without any upfront fees, long-term costs or commitments, and they don't have to be Zocdoc Marketplace customers, the company said. Providers can try out the assistant for $2 per booked appointment, but organizations that want to roll it out on a larger scale can access discounted pricing.  Zocdoc said early adopters of Zo have been able to resolve up to 70% of all scheduling calls without staff intervention. The average call lasts around two minutes and 30 seconds.  While appointment management is Zo's first use case, Zocdoc said it's exploring other applications for the assistant, including prescription refills, messaging and outbound calls like appointment reminders or last-minute openings.  Read the full announcement  .  Feel free to send any tips, suggestions, story ideas and data to Ashley at  .", "summary": null, "related_articles": [], "metadata": {"author": null, "publish_date": "2025-05-07T14:24:03+0000", "read_time": null, "keywords": "David A.

The World Health Organization says maternal mortality is unacceptably high. More than 700 women died every day in 2023 from preventable causes related to pregnancy and childbirth, according to  It's a challenge that doctors, public health authorities and community workers have been trying to tackle. Former professional soccer player Morad Fareed thinks he can make progress improving maternal health through a love of sports. Fareed's created FC Mother, a community platform pairing expectant and new mothers with a support network. The organization aims to turn global football clubs into platforms to improve public health, a broader concept he calls \"H-sports,\" or healing sports.   \"What we did was unify the world of maternal health and use football as a vehicle to distribute it, to celebrate it, and to gamify it,\" said Fareed. The organization is kicking off what it's calling the \"World Cup of Healing\" — a competition that measures health outcomes of the participating women, grouped by their reported soccer fandom.  Mothers access services and connections via the FC Mother platform and then answer regular survey questions that assess their wellbeing. Improvements fuel team progress. FC Mother has some notable buy-in from researchers at Harvard Medical School and Harvard's School of Public Health as well as team doctors from Real Madrid, Manchester United and Arsenal FC.  The initial competition launches on Sunday and runs for 60 days through the FIFA Club World Cup Final in July. This trial run pits three football clubs in Brazil and their associated fanbases of mothers against three in the United States: Mothers of San Diego FC, Mothers of Gotham FC, and Mothers of Omaha Union.  FC Mother ranked the 48 World Cup countries by maternal health outcomes based on data from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington. The institute's Global Burden of Disease report puts the United States at 44th place, lower than any other developed country in the world among that cohort based on life-years lost due to poor maternal health outcomes. Brazil ranks 46th. Team USA in the inaugural health outcomes competition is coached by Jennie Joseph the founder of Commonsense Childbirth, who was named as a woman of the year in 2022 by Time magazine for her national work as a midwife focusing on improving maternal mortality.   Fareed's goal is to gamify community maternal health via football and prove that it can increase quality-adjusted life-years (QUALYs) for both mothers and children.  A QUALY is one year of life in perfect health, a metric that's being used by major public health organizations. It's measured with a survey that asks respondents to self-report mental and emotional health, pain levels and other health domains.   While FC Mother leaves the medical treatment of pregnancy to clinicians, Fareed points to research that illustrates perinatal mental health and robust social support can generate as many as 10 additional higher-quality-of-life years for mothers and their offspring.  \"The social determinants of health are the next frontier of maternal health and public health in general,\" said Fareed. \"It's not your doctor who you're going to call. It's the community around you. It's the day-to-day interactions you have living your life that drive stress levels, mental wellbeing, emotional wellbeing.\" Just like any other sport, FC Mother's leaderboard features the stats of the competing teams, but it also offers opportunities for the users to access immediate support from other moms. Those features are available via the FC Mother App or through Meta's WhatsApp. But FC Mother isn't a charity. Fareed intends it to be a for-profit venture. He believes corporations, professional sports, family offices and donor-advised funds will be interested in investing in a platform that delivers health improvements for a fraction of the current costs of medical intervention. FC Mother hopes the kickoff competition will provide proof-of-concept and convince 40 football clubs to participate in a he maternal health outcomes competition during the World Cup in 2026.  ", "summary": null, "related_articles": [], "metadata": {"author": null, "publish_date": "2025-05-08T10:00:01+0000", "read_time": null, "keywords": "Retail industry,Sports,Social issues,business news"}, "category": "Health and Science"}

The Whoop 5.0 and Whoop MG support 14 days of battery life, which is around triple the four-to-five-day range offered by Whoop 4.0. The new hardware is also 7% smaller than the previous device, with a processor that's 60% faster, the company said.  \"We've taken everything we've learned over the past decade and built a platform to help our members perform and live at their peak for longer,\" Whoop founder and CEO   said in a release.  The launch marks Whoop's first major hardware update since 2021, when the company released Whoop 4.0. Whoop said its new devices will help users understand how their daily decisions impact their performance and   outcomes over time, according to a release. There are three annual membership tiers: Whoop One, which costs $199 and includes the Whoop 5.0; Whoop Peak, which costs $239 and includes the Whoop 5.0; and Whoop Life, which costs $359 and includes the Whoop MG. Accessories like additional bands will come at an extra cost. Whoop 5.0 and Whoop MG memberships and accessories are available for purchase online starting on Thursday. Whoop One members will be able to use their Whoop 5.0 to measure sleep, strain and recovery, as well as the cardiovascular and muscular impact of various workouts. Users can also track their menstrual cycles and pregnancies.  Whoop Peak builds on those core metrics. Members have access to a Health Monitor feature, which provides a quick look at vitals like respiratory rate, heart rate, blood oxygen, and skin temperature. Whoop Peak also supports a real-time stress monitor, where users can see their stress level and complete guided breathing sessions if they'd like to increase relaxation or alertness.  The company also unveiled a feature called Healthspan, which uses nine metrics to calculate adult users' Whoop Age and Pace of Aging. A user's Whoop Age compares their physiological age to their actual age, and Pace of Aging assesses how fast or slow someone is aging based on their behavior.  The Healthspan feature is updated every week, and users will get tips about how they can improve their Whoop Age and Pace of Aging in their app. Whoop developed this feature in partnership with the Buck Institute for Research on Aging, the company said.  The most comprehensive membership is Whoop Life, which will give users access to additional medical-grade health features with Whoop MG.   Whoop Life members can record an electrocardiogram, or an ECG, to detect irregular heart rhythms like AFib, high heart rate or low heart rate. Once the reading is complete, they can share a PDF of the recording with their doctor.  The ECG feature has been cleared by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. It's not intended for users under 22 years old, or for users with a cardiac pacemaker or other implanted devices. It will be available in the U.S., the UAE and Qatar at launch, with additional countries coming soon.  Whoop Life members can also get daily insights about their blood pressure, including estimated systolic and diastolic ranges. Users will have to log a traditional cuff-reading to act as a baseline to unlock this feature, and it's not intended for treatment, diagnosis or medical use.   Whoop said Blood Pressure Insights has been in development for several years, and the feature is currently in beta.   I got a sneak peek at the Whoop MG, and I've been wearing it for the past few days. I can't speak to what it's like to wear the device over an extended period, but my initial experience has been largely positive.  From a hardware standpoint, the Whoop MG looks and feels sleeker than the Whoop 4.0, which I tested out in April. The actual sensor is roughly an inch wide, and the band is slightly thinner than that. I've found that both the Whoop MG and the Whoop 4.0 are a little hard to take off — you really have to tug on the latch.  The Whoop MG's setup is very straightforward, and I was up and running on the app in a matter of minutes. With all the new features, there's a lot of additional data to make sense of, so the app seemed pretty busy to me at first. I felt like I had a better handle on it after a few hours, though, and I haven't felt pressure to constantly monitor it.   Of the new features, I thought Healthspan was particularly interesting. As a relatively healthy 24-year-old, I noticed I still felt relieved to be \"younger\" than my age. I'd be curious to see how that feature would change based on my behaviors from week to week.  I also liked the Whoop MG's detailed sleep tracking and the real-time stress monitor, as stress is something I've personally been trying to be more mindful of. I've learned that my stress levels really skyrocket while I'm taking public transport, for instance, and adjust accordingly. After about a dozen tries, I wasn't able to log a successful ECG reading. I kept getting errors, even after switching wrists and the positioning of my arms. That's been disappointing, as I'm interested to see my results. The Blood Pressure Insights are neat, and assuming other users can successfully record ECG readings, it's easy to see the potential benefit. That said, I don't think I need those features in my daily life yet, so the Whoop Life membership probably wouldn't be the right pick for me.  I'm not totally sold on the Whoop MG's aesthetics. I have small hands and wrists, so I always feel like smart devices tend to look clunky on me.  I definitely felt like the Whoop 4.0 was too big for me, but the Whoop MG doesn't bother me quite as much. That's just my personal taste, and there are lots of Whoop accessories you can buy to spiff up the device for different occasions.  After just a few days, there's a lot I can still learn from the Whoop MG, but I feel like I'd personally reach for the Whoop 5.0. The range of membership options helps ensure that users don't have to break the bank, so I'd feel comfortable recommending Whoop 5.0 and Whoop MG to my friends and family. And for existing Whoop customers who are thinking about an upgrade, the extended battery life alone is worth considering.   ", "summary": null, "related_articles": [], "metadata": {"author": null, "publish_date": "2025-05-08T14:01:03+0000", "read_time": null, "keywords": "Health care industry,Internet,Technology,Breaking News: Technology,business news"}, "category": "Health and Science"}

In lawsuits filed Wednesday, Lilly accuses the sites — Mochi Health, Fella Health, Willow Health and Henry Meds — of deceiving consumers about \"untested, unapproved drugs\" and turning them away from Lilly's medicines. Lilly alleges the companies are claiming to offer personalized options when they are actually mass-marketing slightly different versions of Lilly's drugs in order to skirt FDA rules. Lilly also claims some of the sites are selling formulations of the drugs that haven't been studied, such as oral tablets and drops. Fella, Willow and Henry Meds didn't immediately respond to CNBC's requests for comment. Mochi Health in a statement said its model \"remains compliant with FDA guidance and pharmacy regulations.\"  Lilly's diabetes drug Mounjaro went into short supply in late 2022, allowing pharmacies and outsourcing facilities to produce the treatment, a practice called compounding. Novo Nordisk's weight loss drug Wegovy was also in short supply, opening up the market for compounding GLP-1s. That business boomed online, where people sought versions of the treatments if they couldn't find the brand names or couldn't get them covered by insurance. Mass compounding of tirzepatide, the active ingredient in Mounjaro and Zepbound, was supposed to stop last month after the Food and Drug Administration declared the shortage of the drugs over. Some pharmacies kept doing it anyway, producing versions that differ slightly from the brand name, which could possibly keep them out of the FDA's crosshairs. Earlier this month, Lilly   two pharmacies, alleging they falsely marketed their products as personalized versions of the drugs that have been clinically tested and are made using stringent safety standards. One of the telehealth platforms Lilly is now suing, Mochi Health, planned to continue selling compounded versions of tirzepatide, betting that offering personalized treatments would keep it out of legal trouble, Mochi CEO Myra Ahmad   in March. Asked whether she feared legal action from Lilly, Ahmad said she wasn't worried about her prescribers since \"they have established patient-physician relationships\" and \"the beauty of medicine is really that they get full autonomy to decide what is the best way to manage their patients.\" Lilly in its filing Wednesday claimed Ahmad is not a licensed physician and that Mochi and its \"unlicensed owners exercise undue influence and control over, among other things, the prescribing decisions of physicians\" and as a result engage in the \"unlawful corporate practice of medicine.\" Ahmad in a statement said the use of compounded medications \"remains appropriate and legal when tailored to individual patient needs and prescribed by a licensed medical provider\" and that Mochi's physicians choose which treatments are best for their patients. She said she holds a doctor of medicine degree but is not practicing as CEO of Mochi. Lilly makes a similar allegation against Fella Health, accusing the company of making \"sweeping corporate decisions that dictate patient care, such as when Fella changed patients en masse from one tirzepatide formulation to another with additives.\" In all four cases, Lilly is seeking to stop the sites from marketing or selling tirzepatide.

The company now expects its 2025 adjusted earnings to come in between $8.82 and $8.97, down slightly from a previous outlook of $8.88 to $9.03 per share. The company said the expected tariff charge primarily reflects levies between the U.S. and China, and Canada and Mexico to a lesser degree. Merck has built a robust presence in China, which is considered one of the company's most important markets and is home to some of its partners and manufacturing and research and development sites.  Merck noted that the new outlook does not account for President  's planned tariffs on pharmaceuticals imported into the U.S., which are prompting some drugmakers to   footprints.  That includes Merck, which has invested $12 billion in U.S. manufacturing and research and development and expects to put more than $9 billion more into the country by the end of 2028. On an earnings call on Thursday, Merck CEO Rob Davis said that \"as you look at 2025, we're well positioned with inventory to be able to mitigate anything we could see in the short term.\" He added that in the medium to long term, \"we've already started to identify where we can either reposition our own manufacturing,\" which could look like changing the priorities of existing plants, or bring on external manufacturing to \"bridge gaps\" and build internal production further. \"In many ways, we are aligned with what the administration is wanting to do, and feel that we're in position to be able to do that quite effectively,\" he said. The new guidance does include a one-time charge of roughly 6 cents per share related to the company's license agreement with Hengrui Pharma, which it   in March. Merck reiterated its full-year sales forecast of between $64.1 billion and $65.6 billion.  Also on Thursday, the drugmaker reported first-quarter revenue and profit that beat expectations, as it said it saw strength in its oncology portfolio and animal health products.  Merck also cited \"increasingly meaningful\" sales contributions from two recently launched drugs. They are Winrevair, which is used to treat a rare, deadly lung condition, and Capvaxive, a vaccine designed to protect adults from a bacteria known as pneumococcus that can cause serious illnesses and lung infection.  Sales of those drugs will likely be critical to Merck's efforts to offset losses from its top-selling cancer therapy Keytruda, which will lose exclusivity in 2028.  Here's what Merck reported for the first quarter compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:  The company posted net income of $5.08 billion, or $2.01 per share, for the quarter. That compares with net income of $4.76 billion, or $1.87 per share, during the year-earlier period.  Excluding acquisition and restructuring costs, Merck earned $2.22 per share for the first quarter.  Merck raked in $15.53 billion in revenue for the quarter, down 2% from the same period a year ago. Merck's pharmaceutical unit, which develops a wide range of drugs, booked $13.64 billion in revenue during the first quarter. That's down 3% from the same period a year ago. Keytruda recorded $7.21 billion in revenue during the quarter, up just 4% from the year-earlier period.  That increase was driven by higher uptake of Keytruda for earlier-stage cancers and strong demand for the drug for metastatic cancers, which spread to other parts of the body. Still, sales came under the $7.43 billion that analysts had expected, according to StreetAccount estimates.   Notably, Merck continued to see   of Gardasil, a vaccine that prevents cancer from HPV, the most common sexually transmitted infection in the U.S.  In February, Merck announced a decision to halt shipments of Gardasil into China beginning that month and going through at least mid-2025. Investors will likely be looking for updates on that effort during the earnings call on Thursday.  The Chinese market makes up the majority of the blockbuster shot's international revenue. Merck is hoping that Gardasil's expanded approval for men ages 9 to 26 in China will help boost uptake of the vaccine. Gardasil raked in $1.33 billion in sales, down 41% from the first quarter of 2024 primarily due to lower demand in China. That's below the $1.45 billion that analysts were expecting, according to StreetAccount estimates.  China has retaliated with tariffs of 125% on goods from the U.S. Some experts said China's tariffs on U.S. products could lead to increased prices or limited supply of some popular Western medicines for Chinese patients, Reuters  . Merck's animal health division, which develops vaccines and medicines for dogs, cats and cattle, posted nearly $1.59 billion in sales, up 5% from the same period a year ago. The company said higher demand for livestock products and sales from Elanco's aqua business, which it acquired last year, drove that growth.", "summary": null, "related_articles": [], "metadata": {"author": null, "publish_date": "2025-04-24T10:32:03+0000", "read_time": null, "keywords": "United States,China,Merck & Co Inc,Breaking News: Business,Health care industry,Pharmaceuticals,Biotech and Pharmaceuticals,Biotechnology,Business,Earnings,Donald Trump,Donald J.

The company now expects 2025 revenue to come in between $45.8 billion and $46.8 billion, up from a   of around $45.5 billion. Bristol Myers also projects full-year adjusted earnings of $6.70 to $7 per share, which compares with its prior forecast of $6.55 to $6.85 per share.  Notably, the company said its guidance revisions include the estimated impact of current tariffs on U.S. products shipped to China. China is a critical market for Bristol Myers. The company has   its \"China 2030 Strategy,\" which is a   to bring more of its medicines to the nation to address unmet medical needs in areas like gastric cancer and include more Chinese patients in clinical trials. But the new outlooks do not account for any of President  s planned tariffs on pharmaceuticals imported into the U.S., Bristol Myers said.  In an earnings call Thursday, Bristol Myers Squibb CEO Christopher Boerner said the company appreciated the Trump administration's efforts to increase U.S. manufacturing, but noted that it \"needs to be done in a very thoughtful and deliberate way\" in the pharmaceutical sector. He added that it is \"simply too early to provide a lot more\" on the company's expectations for pharmaceutical-specific tariffs. Still, Bristol Myers is continuing \"mitigation efforts\" to reduce risks of any disruption to the supply chain and shortages, Boerner said. \"We have a tremendous amount of flexibility to be able to move our manufacturing around should any potential tariffs come up,\" said the company's CFO David Elkins on the call. He added that Bristol Myers has a broad global manufacturing network, which includes a significant presence in the U.S. Bristol Myers said the outlook hike reflects strength in its portfolio of newer drug brands, and better-than-anticipated first-quarter sales from its legacy portfolio of older medications.  The results come as Bristol Myers moves to slash $2 billion in expenses by the end of 2027, which is on top of $1.5 billion in planned cost cuts by the end of this year.  It also comes just days after Bristol Myers' recently approved schizophrenia drug, Cobenfy,  , leading some Wall Street analysts to substantially lower their multibillion-dollar sales forecasts for the treatment.   The company is banking on Cobenfy and other so-called growth portfolio drugs to offset the loss in revenue from top-selling treatments slated to lose exclusivity on the market, including its blockbuster blood thinner Eliquis and cancer immunotherapy Opdivo.  Boerner said \"there's a lot of uncertainty, whether related to tariffs, a potential economic downturn or restructuring at the FDA and HHS.\" He is referring to the Trump administration's efforts to   the Food and Drug Administration and other federal health agencies under the Department of Health and Human Services. But the company remains confident in its ability \"to deliver for our patients, employees and shareholders,\" he said. Here is what Bristol Myers reported for the first quarter compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:  Bristol Myers posted net income of $2.5 billion, or $1.20 per share, for the first quarter. That compares with a net loss of $11.9 billion, or a loss of $5.89 per share, for the year-earlier period.  Excluding certain items, it reported adjusted earnings per share of $1.80 for the quarter.  The pharmaceutical giant's revenue fell 6% from the same period a year ago to $11.2 billion.  Eliquis booked $3.57 billion in sales for the quarter, down 4% from the year-ago period. That is above the $3.34 billion that analysts were expecting, according to estimates compiled by StreetAccount. The blood thinner, which Bristol Myers shares with  , is expected to lose market exclusivity by 2028.  Sales of Eliquis could also take a hit in 2026, when a   for the drug goes into effect for certain Medicare patients following negotiations with the federal government. Those price talks are a key provision of the Inflation Reduction Act. The   targets 15 additional drugs and will set new prices that will go into effect in 2028. That includes the Bristol Myers medication Pomalyst, which is used to treat a blood cancer called multiple myeloma and a different cancer that develops in people with HIV. Pomalyst brought in $658 million for the period, down 24% from a year earlier. Revlimid, a drug used to treat adults with multiple myeloma, took in $936 million in sales for the first quarter, down 44% from the same period a year ago.   Revenue from the company's so-called growth portfolio was $5.56 billion for the first quarter, up 16% from the year-earlier period.  Opdivo brought in $2.27 billion in revenue for the first quarter, rising 9% from the year-earlier period.

That came in response to a February lawsuit from a compounding trade group against the Food and Drug Administration's determination that the active ingredient in those drugs, semaglutide, is no longer in shortage in the U.S. Patients flocked to the cheaper copycats when Ozempic and Wegovy were in short supply over the last two years due to skyrocketing demand, or if they didn't have insurance coverage for the costly treatments.  During  , pharmacists can legally make compounded versions of brand-name medications. Many telehealth companies, such as  , also offered those copycats. But drugmakers and some health experts have pushed back against the practice because the FDA does not approve compounded drugs, which are essentially custom-made copies prescribed by a doctor to meet a specific patient's needs.  \"We are pleased the court has rejected the compounders' attempts to undermine FDA's data-based decision that the shortage\" of semaglutide is resolved, said Steve Benz, Novo Nordisk's corporate vice president, legal and U.S. general counsel, in a statement.  \"Patient safety remains a top priority for Novo Nordisk and the extensive nationwide legal actions we have taken to protect Americans from the health risks posed by illegitimate 'semaglutide' drugs are working,\" he said, referring to the company's more than 100 lawsuits against compounding pharmacies and other entities across 32 states.  On Thursday, U.S. District Judge Mark Pittman specifically denied the Outsourcing Facilities Association's bid for a preliminary injunction that would have prevented the FDA from taking action against its members for making copies of semaglutide.  That decision upholds the FDA's previous determination that the semaglutide shortage in the U.S. is over and means the FDA can now immediately go after so-called 503A pharmacies that are making compounded versions of semaglutide according to individual prescriptions for a specific patient. Those pharmacies are largely regulated by states rather than the FDA. The decision also means the FDA can start targeting federally regulated 503B pharmacies, which manufacture compounded drugs in bulk with or without prescriptions, after May 22. The agency's actions can include product seizures and warning letters to pharmacies.  The decision on Thursday follows another win for Novo Nordisk. A different federal judge in Texas earlier this week ruled in favor of the drugmaker against a 503A pharmacy, MediOak Pharmacy, permanently prohibiting the business from marketing or selling compounded semaglutide.

The FDA declared the U.S. shortage of tirzepatide over last year, prompting the same compounding trade group to sue the FDA over the drug.  In March, a federal judge denied the compounding group's request for a preliminary injunction on the FDA's enforcement against its members for making copies of Mounjaro and Zepbound.

The company previously said its cost-cutting program would deliver overall net cost savings of roughly $4.5 billion by the end of 2025. On Tuesday, Pfizer said it now expects additional savings of roughly $1.2 billion, primarily in selling, informational and administrative expenses, by the end of 2027.  The company said that will be driven in large part by \"enhanced digital enablement,\" including automation and artificial intelligence and streamlining business processes. The expanded cuts also include expected research and development reorganization cost savings of around $500 million by the end of 2026, the company added. Those savings will be reinvested into Pfizer's product pipeline.  Pfizer has a  to slash costs, with the first phase of the effort slated to deliver $1.5 billion in savings by the end of 2027. With the added cuts announced Tuesday, Pfizer now expects to deliver around $7.7 billion in savings by the end of that year from the two cost-cutting efforts. The cuts aim to help the pharmaceutical giant recover from the rapid decline of its Covid business and stock price over the last few years, and appear to be paying off. Here's what the company reported for the   compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:  The results come as drugmakers brace for President  's planned tariffs on pharmaceuticals imported into the U.S. – his administration's bid to boost U.S. manufacturing of medications.  Unlike other companies grappling with evolving trade policy, Pfizer did not revise its outlook. The company maintained its full-year 2025 outlook, forecasting sales of $61 billion to $64 billion, with a similar performance from its Covid products as seen in 2024, however Pfizer noted in its earnings release that the guidance \"does not currently include any potential impact related to future tariffs and trade policy changes, which we are unable to predict at this time.\" But on the earnings call on Tuesday, Pfizer executives said the guidance does reflect $150 million in costs from Trump's existing tariffs. \"Included in our guidance that we didn't really speak about is there are some tariffs in place today,\" Pfizer CFO Dave Denton said on the call. \"We are contemplating that within our guidance range and we continue to again trend to the top end of our guidance range even with those costs to be incurred this year,\" he said. On the call, Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla said the company established a team to analyze a range of potential outcomes and develop strategies to help mitigate the potential impact of tariffs on its business in the short and long term. That team is managing current inventory levels in certain jurisdictions and leveraging Pfizer's domestic manufacturing footprint, among other efforts. \"Should we be impacted by further tariffs in the future, we will assess the impact of the policies enacted and provide information at the appropriate time,\" Bourla said. He added that uncertainty around Trump's pharmaceutical tariffs is deterring the company from further investing in U.S. manufacturing and research and development. Pfizer still expects that   resulting from the Inflation Reduction Act will hurt sales by $1 billion, dampening growth by approximately 1.6% compared with 2024. Stripping out one-time items, the company expects 2025 earnings to be in the range of $2.80 to $3 a share.  \"With the underlying strength of our business, we believe we can be agile in navigating an uncertain and volatile external environment,\" Bourla said in a release. For the first quarter, the company booked net income of $2.97 billion, or 52 cents per share. That compares with net income of $3.12 billion, or 55 cents per share, during the same period a year ago.  Excluding certain items, including restructuring charges and costs associated with intangible assets, the company posted earnings per share of 92 cents for the quarter. Pfizer reported revenue of $13.72 billion for the first quarter, down 8% from the same period a year ago. The company said the decrease in sales was primarily driven by a decline in revenue for Paxlovid, which posted $491 million in sales during the first quarter, down 76% from the same period a year ago, in part due to lower Covid infections worldwide and reduced international government purchases of the drug. The drop in sales also reflects a boost Pfizer got in the first quarter of 2024 from a final adjustment related to a previously recorded revenue reversal for Paxlovid.  Analysts had expected Paxlovid to generate $769.7 million in sales for the first quarter, according to StreetAccount estimates. Meanwhile, the company's Covid shot, Comirnaty, booked $565 million in revenue, up 60% from the same period a year ago. That's above the $352 million that analysts were expecting, according to StreetAccount. The results come as shot makers like Pfizer face uncertainty over immunization policy and regulation under Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a prominent vaccine skeptic who now oversees the nation's federal health agencies. As secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, Kennedy has pursued a sweeping overhaul of different agencies, cutting staff, consolidating or eliminating offices and taking actions that could ultimately undermine vaccines.", "summary": null, "related_articles": [], "metadata": {"author": null, "publish_date": "2025-04-29T10:59:28+0000", "read_time": null, "keywords": "Breaking News: Earnings,Earnings,Pfizer Inc,Business,Biotechnology,Biotech and Pharmaceuticals,Pharmaceuticals,Health care industry,Breaking News: Business,Dividends,United States,Albert Bourla,Donald J.

Patients flocked to those compounded versions while Wegovy was in shortage due to skyrocketing demand.  \"We felt it was really important to work hard to establish a collaboration with telehealth companies so that there could be access to Wegovy as the compounding is winding down,\" Dave Moore, executive vice president of U.S. operations at Novo Nordisk, told CNBC.  \"We're really pleased about the level of interest to access branded Wegovy and to start to sort of catch people as they come off of compounded medicine,\" he said.  Moore added that the new partnerships make the experience \"seamless\" for patients since it allows them to access Wegovy straight from their telehealth providers, which \"makes it very easy\" for them to get the drug shipped directly to their homes.  Patients will be able to access Novo Nordisk's new direct-to-consumer online pharmacy,  , directly through the   providers.  That pharmacy offers Wegovy for $499 in cash per month – roughly half its usual monthly list price  – for patients without insurance coverage for the weekly injection.  Each telehealth company's price may be higher because they likely include additional services, a Novo Nordisk spokesperson told CNBC.  Hims & Hers said it will begin offering all dose sizes of Wegovy along with access to 24/7 care, nutritional guidance and ongoing clinical support this week, starting at $599 per month to eligible cash-paying patients with a prescription.  The medication will cost Hims & Hers customers more since it comes with added access to care, the company's CEO, Andrew Dudum, told CNBC in an interview. He said he thinks the company's partnership with Novo Nordisk will serve as a case study for how patients get access to and get prices for \"great medicine\" and other forms of treatment.  Ro opted for the lower price, announcing Tuesday it will offer access to all doses of Wegovy for $499 per month.

The company has largely had to stop offering the compounded medications en masse, but some consumers may still be able to access personalized doses if it's clinically applicable, Dudum said.  \"That was one of the first things we shared with Novo is that we will always fight on behalf of what consumers we believe have the right to get,\" Dudum said. \"The regulation is very clear.\"  During  , pharmacists can legally make compounded versions of brand-name medications. They can also be produced on a case-by-case basis when it's medically necessary for a patient, such as when they can't swallow a pill or are allergic to a specific ingredient in a branded drug.  But drugmakers and some health experts have pushed back against the practice, largely because the FDA does not approve compounded drugs.  Larger, federally regulated compounding pharmacies that make copies of semaglutide in bulk without prescriptions face a legal deadline of May 22 to stop marketing and selling those versions.

Twenty-five years later, the company is still serving women, \"a lot of women,\" Strober says. She was a pregnant venture investor at the time she made the BabyCenter investment, and it helped to spark a bigger idea: for too long, she says, the storyline for women facing challenges has been \"just deal with it.\" \"It's a weird thing ... and that's just really unhealthy, and we have to change that,\" Strober said at the recent CNBC Changemakers Summit in Los Angeles. For Chelsea Hirschhorn, having her first child led her to become \"totally disillusioned\" with the chasm between the image of new parenthood that was marketed and the reality she experienced. \"The picture-perfect image of parenting was overwhelming for a new parent,\" she said. \"There was a big dichotomy between the content I was consuming and the front-line experience at 3 a.m.\" Hirschhorn says there was no data available at the time to substantiate what she felt because the topic was understudied and underfunded, so she \"took on\" the category of infant health and wellness. \"For whatever reason,\" Hirschhorn says, she had \"the conviction to think I could fix this.\" While there is a distinction between the health challenges the two female CEO and founders focus on — not every woman will become pregnant but all will go through menopause — one big idea binds the two women leaders together: products, treatments and services exist that can meet critical needs in an underserved, and undervalued, market. \"We have this idea that perimenopause is at a certain time and people think they have to suffer for a really long time before they get the right care, but what we say is you don't have to suffer at all,\" Strober shared at the Changemakers Summit. \"As soon as you're in your 30s and anything starts feeling wrong, you should get help. The idea of suffering is really outdated,\" she said. \"Women have been trained to suffer for far too long.\"  and   were both named to the  . (Actress and entrepreneur  , who has become a leading advocate for menopause health as founder and chief creative officer at Stripes Beauty after struggling with early menopause at the height of her early Hollywood fame, was also among the 2025 Changemakers.) At the Changemakers Summit on April 8, the two women CEOs shared advice and lessons from their successes bringing new business ideas to health care. Here are a few of the key themes they touched on in a discussion with CNBC's Kate Rooney. In addition to \"the dearth of information\" that exists to prepare women for the reality of parenthood, educational content for women has been censored when on topics related to reproductive health. That was something that Hirschhorn learned once she started Frida, a time when it was \"almost impossible,\" she says, to find authentic storytelling on the subject matter, and led her to create  . \"Sixty percent of women's health ads content, or content in general, has been in some way, shape or form, rejected or filtered,\" she said. That's not just online but on linear television, part of what Hirschhorn calls a \"very gendered dichotomy,\" citing the fact that male health and sexual wellness content is approved at a significantly higher rate. That leaves her \"incredulous,\" she said, and it is a call to action to shift from women's health being a topic of provocation to a topic of public health. \"Women have to advocate for themselves,\" she said. \"Women can't be complacent, and this goes beyond health care. This can drive real change, in retail ... in every facet of life,\" she added. Strober noted that when she was building Midi Health it became clear that a major challenge would be working with codes created by the insurance industry for menopause, in effect, another form of institutional censorship. Midi Health decided to position itself as an in-network primary care provider that had a specialty in menopause and that turned out to be a \"really effective\" way to gain traction, she says, and it now has nationwide insurance coverage with all the large insurance companies in the U.S. \"They are not necessarily going to cover sexual health issues but they will cover primary care, so you just subsume it,\" she explained. By viewing menopause as just part of women's health, she says, the company was able to create a reimbursement mechanism that meets insurance standards. That insurance coverage is a very big deal, because research is showing that lack of menopause treatment can have a high cost when it comes to women's careers.   Strober pointed to during the Changemakers discussion found that at the mid-career moment when women should be gaining their greatest successes in the workplace, the shift into menopause can hold them back. Strober said the growing body of research details how menopause can result in discrimination at work, with women quitting jobs, or not going for raises or promotions because of symptoms, and also because they don't believe they can get the treatment that they need. \"If you believe that you have something that can't be fixed, it's very embarrassing, and that means people step back from what they are doing,\" Strober said. \"They are scared,\" she added. That can be the experience that is called brain fog, and also hot flashes. \"You lose power during hot flashes,\" Strober said. \"People are not as confident. But if you are getting treated for it, 'it's just a hot flash' and you can regain power,\" she added. Hirschhorn says that by the numbers, there is still huge potential in the women's health market. It is estimated to grow to $60 billion by 2027, according to data she cited at the event, and that is despite the fact that less than 4% of health-care R&D spending and investment goes to the category — a \"seismic gap,\" she said. It is a well-known fact in consumer research that women dominate household spending, but Hirschhorn said in Frida's market there is a \"viral\" opportunity that is underappreciated. \"Creating products for women based on real need creates a virality that is hard to recreate with other demographics,\" she said. \"These women aren't just buying their products, they are selling them to their communities and friends. We call that 'word of mom,\" Hirschhorn said. \"It's a really big untapped opportunity,\" she added. As a former venture investor, Strober said it is important to accept that \"people are not dying to invest in women's health,\" but she added that when you can show the growth that companies like Midi Health are posting, that won't slow a company down. \"We are the fastest-growing digital health company, probably ever, quite honestly,\" she said. \"We are growing insanely fast because women really need access to this care and can't get it elsewhere,\" she added. Similar to the \"virality\" experienced by Frida, Strober says the business model does build on itself. \"Once you take care of one thing for women they come back to you for something else, and if you develop this trusted platform for them, where they become your long-term patient, that is a good business,\" she said. \"We don't say it's a women's business, we say it's a really good business,\" she added. That opportunity and the unfiltered realities of parenthood have now grown Frida to more than 150 products, covering everything from conception to post-partum and breastfeeding care, and beyond. \"My four children are a hotbed of inspiration and my 'snot sucking' days are almost over,\" Hirschhorn said. But she added, \"The same problems exist, you just need a different toolkit.\" At Midi Health, Strober says the next big opportunity to unlock is making connections between menopause health and longevity. \"If you take care of yourself in your 40s you can really prevent a lot of the diseases that come in your 80s, and so we have been thinking a lot about this longevity market,\" Strober said. \"It's all bros, all the bros who are out there and talking about wanting to live to 150. We just want to take care of ourselves. We don't care about living to 150. We just want to be healthy grandmas,\" she said. \"What do we do, how do we take care of our brains and bones and hearts to age in a healthy way?\" Strober asks. She says there are many treatments, products and services yet to be developed by health companies that will help women in their 40s, 50s and 60s to better answer that question.", "summary": null, "related_articles": [], "metadata": {"author": null, "publish_date": "2025-04-29T19:23:50+0000", "read_time": null, "keywords": "Menopause,Health,Gender issues,Health care industry,Health insurance,Suppress Zephr,Social issues,business news"}, "category": "Health and Science"}

For many, the big question is whether the pricey medications known as GLP-1s will pay off by improving worker health and lowering overall health costs over time. Analysts at Aon say it's already happening.   \"We've never seen anything like this, really,\" said Greg Case, CEO of  , an employer benefits services firm. \"There was a 44% reduction in major cardiovascular issues. There was substantial reduction in osteoporosis. There was substantial reduction in pneumonia of multiple types.\" Aon researchers found that within two years, patients taking GLP-1 drugs saw improved health outcomes, which significantly slowed the growth rate of their medical costs. The rate of growth, known as the medical cost trend – was cut roughly in half, the researchers said.     GLP-1s come at a list price of more than $1,000 per dose. As broader approval for the drugs spurs higher demand, it's also causing employer drug spending to spike. Since 2023, GLP-1s have pushed costs up at a faster pace than high-priced specialty medications, which include costly cancer and autoimmune treatments,   by Evernorth, a division of  . Aon analysts looked at medical claims data for 139,000 U.S.-based workers with employer health coverage who took GLP-1 medications between 2022 and 2024. Beyond the drug costs, the study found GLP-1 patients tend to incur higher medical costs in their first year on the drugs, with more doctor visits to monitor their treatment on the drug and to seek help for other issues such as sleep apnea and esophageal conditions like acid reflux. \"The increase comes about in the first 12 to 15 months,\" Case said. \"They're getting remedies on things that actually are underlying conditions [of obesity].\" But by the end of the second year of treatment with the GLP-1 drugs, the medical cost trend for patients taking them slowed by 7% on average, compared to workers with similar chronic conditions and obesity characteristics who were not taking the drugs, Aon found. For those not taking the drug, the medical cost trend was 14%. The biggest driver of those savings was the reduction by more than 40% of major adverse cardiac events such as heart attacks and strokes, compared with patients who were not taking the drugs, as well as a reduction in the onset of diabetes.  Case said with this data, Aon has been able to help clients understand the timeline for seeing a return on providing insurance coverage for GLP-1s for weight loss, in addition to Type 2 diabetes. \"We saw every single place where the cost went down — and it's stunning,\" said Case. \"You can do this in a way that has an ROI, that will literally be an economic return.\" Following its research, Aon has launched a subsidized GLP-1 weight management program for its own U.S. workforce, which includes weekly virtual wellness visits and home blood tests to help employees adhere to the drug regimen.

Kennedy Jr.'s   of the Department of Health and Human Services involves deep cuts to several divisions that help protect and improve the health of minority and underserved populations and eliminate health disparities in the U.S., CNBC has learned. Kennedy, the Health and Human Services secretary, has gutted at least seven minority health offices across the department, according to people familiar with the matter, who requested anonymity to speak freely. HHS has laid off a significant share of workers at those offices, or in some cases all of them, along with their directors, the people said. The affected units include the HHS Office of Minority Health and the National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities, or  . The cuts also hit offices with similar functions at the Food and Drug Administration, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, the Health Resources and Services Administration, and the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, according to the people.  Health policy experts told CNBC that deep cuts to those divisions could widen existing health disparities in the U.S., undoing years of progress toward addressing them. Over time, that could worsen health outcomes for already underserved groups, threaten overall public health, strain the U.S. health-care system and drive up health-care costs.  \"It will have negative health impacts, obviously, for groups that they're focused on, so racial and ethnic minorities, but I think what gets missed in the story is it ultimately impacts all of us, no matter what your background is,\" Dr. Stephanie Ettinger De Cuba, research professor of health law, policy and management at Boston University, told CNBC.  \"It's not a zero-sum game. So I think that's what is deeply disturbing to me, as we are going to see people get hurt,\" she said. \"Decimating or cutting staff from these offices ultimately makes it worse for everyone.\" The Trump administration can't shutter the affected offices entirely, which would   since they were authorized by the Affordable Care Act more than a decade ago, the people said. The exact fate of each office and the NIH institute is unclear, they added.  The administration likely hopes to at least \"narrow the scope\" of what NIMHD and the agency offices do, curtailing their authority and limiting resources, said Brandyn Churchill, professor of public administration and policy at American University.  The cuts come as health disparities remain a major challenge in the U.S., affecting not only people of color but also rural residents, low-income communities and individuals with disabilities, among several other groups. These communities often face worse health outcomes – such as lower life expectancy and higher rates of infant mortality and chronic disease – and more limited access to care and other resources than the U.S. population as a whole.  The Covid-19 pandemic deepened many of these gaps, highlighting how the long U.S. history of exclusionary policies and systemic issues such as poverty and racism contribute to unequal health outcomes across the country.  Health policy experts stress that addressing those disparities leads to stronger overall public health, as healthier communities improve outcomes for everyone. It could also relieve a huge economic burden on the U.S: a   found that racial and ethnic health disparities cost the U.S. economy $451 billion in 2018.   Kennedy is consolidating divisions and slashing 10,000 jobs at HHS,   that oversees vaccines and other medicines, scientific research, public health infrastructure, pandemic preparedness, and food and tobacco products. HHS also manages government-funded health care for millions of Americans – including seniors, disabled people and lower-income patients who rely on Medicare, Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act's markets. Kennedy plans to create a new HHS agency called the Administration for a Healthy America, which will combine several existing offices. That includes HRSA, SAMHSA, the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Health, the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry, and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health. A leaked 64-page preliminary budget document also indicates that the HHS Office of Minority Health would fall under that new agency, according to several reports. But that proposal, which would slash the HHS budget by a third, or roughly $40 billion, requires congressional approval.  HHS did not immediately respond to a request for comment. While the breadth of the cutbacks varied at agencies within HHS, the minority health agencies across the departments will now be only a fraction of their former size. All 40 staff members at the CMS Office of Minority Health were laid off, according to the people. CMS plans to appoint a new director for that unit, but the current director has not resigned from the role, CNBC previously  .  The office works with local and federal partners to eliminate disparities in health coverage, aiming to ensure that minority and underserved populations can access Medicare, Medicaid and Affordable Care Act marketplace plans. It also conducts research and analysis to help lower costs and reduce the incidence and severity of chronic diseases in the U.S.  Nearly all staff at the CDC's Office of Minority Health were cut, according to the people. To adhere to the letter of the law, the Trump administration is considering reconstituting that unit and the Office of Women's Health so that each office would be made up of at least one director or a very small group of employees, the people said.  The agency's Office of Minority Health works across CDC to promote research of health disparities and create programs to improve the health of racial and ethnic minority groups. At the FDA's Office of Minority Health and Health Equity, all staff were cut, the people said. The future of that office is unclear.  The unit focuses on efforts such as increasing clinical trial diversity, improving transparency around how medical products affect different populations, and creating health resources tailored to a range of languages and cultures. No staff are left at HRSA's Office of Health Equity after the layoffs, as well as some retirements and reassignments, according to the people. That office leads efforts to reduce disparities in health-care access, quality and outcomes through HRSA, which focuses on people who are uninsured, geographically isolated, or economically and medically vulnerable. The future of that office is also unclear, apart from the Trump administration's plans to fold HRSA into Kennedy's new agency. The same goes for SAMHSA's , which saw all remaining staff cut except for a new, recently hired director, according to the people. The office also had a retirement and one worker on probation who was put on administrative leave.  The office works to ensure that SAMHSA's resources for mental health and substance abuse treatment, including grant programs and other initiatives, are equitably distributed across all communities and populations. Roughly a third of staff are gone at NIMHD, some of whom were laid off and others who left due to early retirements and buyouts, the people said. Some workers on probation were put on leave several weeks before Kennedy started cuts, they said.  The institute's deputy director accepted an offer to be acting director in the short term, the people added. NIMHD, which is part of the National Institutes of Health, works to reduce health disparities through conducting and funding research and developing new programs. The HHS Office of Minority Health also faced cuts, though it's unclear how many staff were impacted, the people said. That office leads the federal effort to improve health outcomes for racial and ethnic minority groups, developing policies and programs and providing funding. It will likely take several months to a year before the U.S. sees direct consequences from the cuts to NIMHD and the offices, said Terry McGovern, professor at the CUNY Graduate School of Public Health and Health Policy. But the staff reductions could cause the U.S. to lose out on crucial data, which is the cornerstone for addressing health disparities, according to Samantha Artiga, director for the racial equity and health policy program at KFF, a health policy research organization.  Artiga said data and research are essential for pinpointing where disparities exist, understanding their root causes, crafting effective solutions, and tracking progress over time. For example, data can reveal whether certain groups experience worse surgical outcomes or wait longer at the emergency room, or if a vaccination program is being equitably distributed across regions. \"Without focused data and research, those disparities may remain unseen and unaddressed, creating blind spots,\" Artiga said, adding that the U.S. would eventually have to rebuild that knowledge in the future.  The fate of many of the grants that NIMHD and some of the offices provide is unclear. That includes  from HHS' Office of Minority Health to 20 organizations for a four-year initiative to identify strategies that increase the use of preventive health services in communities.  But if offices cut back that funding or stop it altogether, it could also weaken the nation's ability to reduce health disparities, Boston University's Ettinger De Cuba said.  Community-based organizations rely on federal money to deliver culturally tailored care to different groups, and could be forced to scale back or shut down programs. The loss of grants could also stall research, innovation and public health interventions by outside entities, such as universities, health-care systems and social service organizations.  \"Philanthropy is not able to step up at this level long term. The only actor that's able to do that is the government,\" Ettinger De Cuba said.  Nathan Boucher, research professor at Duke's Sanford School of Public Policy, added that the cuts will \"degrade any effort of these larger governmental organizations to have any accountability when it comes to protecting the people they help and serve every day.\"  While Kennedy has said his cuts are focused on making HHS more \"responsive and efficient,\" Boucher said targeting minority health offices could do the opposite.  \"I actually think it's an efficiency argument to be able to have these minority health offices, because it allows you to identify and target some real problem areas and use taxpayer dollars in the most efficient way possible,\" said Boucher. ", "summary": null, "related_articles": [], "metadata": {"author": null, "publish_date": "2025-04-30T16:42:17+0000", "read_time": null, "keywords": "Breaking News: Politics,Business,Biotechnology,Biotech and Pharmaceuticals,Pharmaceuticals,Health care industry,Breaking News: Business,Politics,business news"}, "category": "Health and Science"}

Still, it could elevate production costs and drug prices, raising affordability concerns, GlobalData said.  Here's a list of the companies that have announced new U.S. investments since Trump took office:  Other companies, such as  , also announced U.S. investments last year.  Meanwhile, Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla on Tuesday said uncertainty around pharmaceutical tariffs is deterring the company from further investing in U.S. manufacturing and research and development.  \"If I know that there will not be tariffs ... then there are tremendous investments that can happen in this country, both in R&D and manufacturing,\" Bourla said on the call, adding that the company is also hoping for \"certainty.\" Feel free to send any tips, suggestions, story ideas and data to Annika at  .  on Tuesday announced that data from its Libre continuous glucose monitoring systems will integrate directly with Epic Systems' electronic health record (EHR) software in the U.S.  A continuous glucose monitor, or a CGM, is a small sensor that pokes through the skin and sends real-time glucose readings to an app. Glucose is a type of sugar people get from food, and it's people's main energy source. Managing glucose is crucial for patients with diabetes to   serious health problems, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  Abbott's integration with Epic will allow doctors to view their patients' glucose data before, during and after visits, and it's meant to help them access the information in a simple and actionable way. Abbott is working with Epic's Aura software, which connects health systems with medical device manufacturers and diagnostics labs, according to a release.  Abbott said there's more to come.  \"While the integration with Libre data is Abbott's first medical device offering with Epic, it's just the beginning,\" Lisa Earnhardt, executive vice president of medical devices for Abbott, said in a release. \"We aim to expand this model to our other medical devices and connected care platforms in the future.\" Abbott sells a range of CGM systems, and it's the market leader in the space based on number of users, according to a 2024 market model from the firm William Blair.  Dexcom, a competing CGM company, is the second largest player behind Abbott, according to William Blair. Dexcom also offers its own direct EHR integration solution, which is available to customers using Epic's software. An EHR is a digital version of a patient's medical history that's updated by doctors and nurses. It's crucial software within the modern U.S. health-care system. Epic, the leading EHR vendor in the U.S., stores the medical records of more than 280 million Americans. \"Diabetes requires close collaboration between patients, primary care providers, and specialists to manage a complex and time-critical care plan,\" Alan Hutchison, vice president at Epic, said in the release. \"This will help everyone focus more on patient care and less on administrative hurdles.\" Feel free to send any tips, suggestions, story ideas and data to Ashley at  .", "summary": null, "related_articles": [], "metadata": {"author": null, "publish_date": "2025-04-30T20:12:24+0000", "read_time": null, "keywords": "Biotech and Pharmaceuticals,Health care industry,Social issues,United States,Donald Trump,GSK plc,GSK plc,Merck & Co Inc,Abbvie Inc,LILLY DRN,Johnson & Johnson,Roche Holding AG,Novartis AG,Novartis AG,Abbott Laboratories,business news"}, "category": "Health and Science"}

The company now expects full-year adjusted earnings of $6 to $6.20 per share, up from a previous guidance of $5.75 to $6 per share But the company revised its GAAP diluted EPS guidance to be lower, which includes charges related to a legal battle involving its pharmacy services provider subsidiary, Omnicare. A jury this week found Omnicare liable for dispensing drugs without valid prescriptions to elderly and disabled individuals in assisted living and long-term care facilities. CVS plans to appeal. The company did not provide a revenue forecast for the year. CVS said it is \"maintaining a cautious view for the remainder of the year\" in light of continued higher medical costs and \"the potential for macro headwinds.\" \"We got smarter about the markets that we wanted and the lives that we wanted to compete for, and so we actually have planned and budgeted for the elevated trends,\" CVS CEO David Joyner said in an interview with CNBC, referring to markets that the insurance unit operates in and higher medical costs \"So I think why you're not seeing a surprise on our part is because we actually plan for elevated trends going into this year,\" he added. Joyner said the company is watching for the potential impact from President  s planned tariffs on pharmaceuticals imported into the U.S. \"On the pharmacy side, I think it is highly dependent on what happens in the next week or two when they announce the implications of tariffs on the manufacturers,\" he told CNBC. Joyner added that the vast majority of the company's retail products at the front of stores are sourced in the U.S., \"which should be a benefit for us.\" Here's what CVS reported for the first quarter compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:  The company's insurer, Aetna, and its rivals have been dogged by higher-than-expected medical costs over the last year as more Medicare Advantage patients return to hospitals for procedures they delayed during the pandemic. But for the first time in several quarters, CVS' insurance business appeared to show some signs of improvement. The unit's medical benefit ratio — a measure of total medical expenses paid relative to premiums collected — decreased to 87.3% from 90.4% a year earlier. A lower ratio typically indicates that a company collected more in premiums than it paid out in benefits, resulting in higher profitability. CVS said the move partly reflects stronger underlying performance in its Medicare business and improved Medicare Advantage star ratings for the 2025 payment year. Those ratings help patients compare the quality of Medicare health and drug plans. \"I think that investment and talent that allowed us to focus on both the execution and the operation … actually helped establish the performance that you're seeing,\" Joyner said, referring to an executive reshuffling last year that tapped a new leader for the insurance unit and other parts of the business. The results cap off the second full quarter with  , a longtime CVS executive, as chief executive of the retail drugstore chain. Joyner succeeded Karen Lynch in mid-October, as CVS struggled to drive higher profits and improve its stock performance. The company underwent a management reshuffle as part of a broader turnaround plan that includes   in cost cuts over the next several years. Still, CVS' performance was partially offset by a charge of $431 million from so-called premium deficiency reserves in the insurance unit, which is related to anticipated losses in the 2025 coverage year. That refers to a liability that an insurer may need to cover if future premiums are not enough to pay for anticipated claims and expenses. The company posted net income of $1.78 billion, or $1.41 per share, for the first quarter. That compares with net income of $1.12 billion, or 88 cents per share, for the year-earlier period.  Excluding certain items, such as amortization of intangible assets, restructuring charges and capital losses, adjusted earnings were $2.25 per share for the quarter. CVS booked sales of $94.59 billion for the first quarter, up 7% from the same period a year ago due to growth across all three of its business segments.  But sales in the company's retail pharmacy segment missed Wall Street's expectations for the quarter, according to StreetAccount. That business has been pressured by softer consumer spending and lower reimbursements for prescription drugs.  CVS' insurance business booked $34.81 billion in revenue during the quarter, up 8% from the first quarter of 2024. Analysts expected the unit to take in $33.51 billion for the period, according to estimates from StreetAccount. The unit also recorded adjusted operating income of $1.99 billion for the first quarter, compared with $732 million for the year-earlier period.  Also on Thursday, CVS said Aetna will stop offering health insurance plans on the Affordable Care Act marketplaces — also known as individual exchanges — starting in the 2026 plan year. CVS' pharmacy and consumer wellness division booked $31.91 billion in sales for the first quarter, up more than 11% from the same period a year earlier. But that was far under the $35.27 billion that analysts were expecting for the quarter, according to StreetAccount. That unit dispenses prescriptions in CVS' more than 9,000 retail pharmacies and provides other pharmacy services, such as vaccinations and diagnostic testing. CVS' health services segment generated $43.46 billion in revenue for the quarter, up nearly 8% compared with the same quarter in 2024. Analysts expected the unit to post $43.64 billion in sales for the period, according to StreetAccount. That unit includes Caremark, one of the nation's largest pharmacy benefit managers.

The move is part of a new partnership between Caremark and Wegovy's manufacturer,  , according to CVS'   release. Caremark will also drop the weight loss drug Zepbound from its standard formularies on that date, in a blow to its manufacturer,  , a CVS spokesperson told CNBC. They said those standard formularies are the most common among Caremark's client base, representing tens of millions of patients. Eligible patients covered by Caremark who are currently taking Zepbound will be able to switch to Wegovy, the spokesperson said. Shares of Novo Nordisk closed around 1% lower on Thursday, while Eli Lilly's stock closed more than 11% lower.  It comes as Novo Nordisk works to boost access to Wegovy now that it is no longer in   in the U.S. Partnering with Caremark, one of the nation's largest pharmacy benefit managers, could help the drugmaker reach even more patients. Caremark discounts drugs with manufacturers on behalf of insurance plans and creates lists of medications, or formularies, that are covered by insurance and reimburses pharmacies for prescriptions. Caremark will make the drug available to its members at \"a more affordable price.\" The PBM negotiated a lower net price for Wegovy over Zepbound on its standard formularies, offering savings to clients that opt into those plans, the CVS spokesperson said. But Caremark's clients, which are employers and unions, \"individually determine how much of that savings on Wegovy gets shared with its members either via lower premiums or lower copays at the pharmacy counter,\" the spokesperson said.  Separately, any patient who does not have insurance coverage for Wegovy or another GLP-1 can still buy Novo Nordisk's drug out-of-pocket for $499 at any of CVS' 9,000 pharmacies nationwide, the spokesperson added.  In its earnings release, CVS said it is the first retail pharmacy partnering with Novo Nordisk's new direct-to-consumer online pharmacy,  , to dispense Wegovy to patients with prescriptions. NovoCare offers Wegovy at that lower price point to cash-paying patients, who may struggle to shoulder the drug's roughly $1,000 list price before insurance and other rebates. Caremark will also combine Wegovy with additional lifestyle support, such as personalized nutrition plans, as part of the CVS Weight Management program. The announcement comes as the Danish drugmaker races to capture more patients now that many compounding pharmacies are legally restricted from making cheaper, unapproved versions of Wegovy, with rare exceptions. \"It's unknown at this point how the migration from the compound pharmacies into other pharmacy settings are going to occur,\" CVS Health group president Prem Shah said on an earnings call on Thursday. \"But we do expect that there will be obviously some benefit by opening up 9,000 stores, or 9,000 opportunities for patients to be able to get the medication.\" Dave Moore, Novo Nordisk's executive vice president of U.S. operations, said in a separate release on Thursday that \"it is our responsibility to continue to work with others across the US healthcare system to find innovative opportunities to meet the needs of these patients and connect them with authentic, FDA-approved Wegovy … in a convenient and affordable way.\"", "summary": null, "related_articles": [], "metadata": {"author": null, "publish_date": "2025-05-01T10:31:30+0000", "read_time": null, "keywords": "Breaking News: Business,Health care industry,Pharmaceuticals,Biotech and Pharmaceuticals,Biotechnology,Business,CVS Health Corp,Novo Nordisk A/S,Novo Nordisk A/S,LILLY DRN,business news"}, "category": "Health and Science"}

The pharmaceutical giant now expects its adjusted fiscal 2025 earnings to come in between $20.78 and $22.28 per share, down from previous guidance of $22.50 to $24 per share. Eli Lilly said the revision reflects a $1.57 billion deal charge recorded in the first quarter, which is primarily related to its acquisition of a certain oral cancer drug from Scorpion Therapeutics. The company maintained its fiscal 2025 sales guidance of $58 billion to $61 billion. Eli Lilly said the guidance reflects President  's existing tariffs as of May 1, but does not include his planned levies on pharmaceuticals imported into the U.S. In an interview with CNBC, Eli Lilly CEO Dave Ricks said the company and other drugmakers are already announcing  , which is one of the Trump administration's stated goals of the tariffs. \"I think that actually the threat of tariffs is already bringing back critical supply chains into important industries, chips and pharma,\" Ricks said. \"So do we need to enact [tariffs?] I'm not so sure.\" He added that Eli Lilly wants to see permanently lower tax rates in the U.S., particularly 15% for domestic production. Ricks said lower taxes drove many drugmakers to manufacture in \"low-tax islands like Ireland Singapore and in Switzerland, and that can come back if there's an economic incentive.\" Eli Lilly's blockbuster diabetes treatment Mounjaro topped expectations for the first quarter, raking in $3.84 billion in revenue. That's up a whopping 113% from the same period a year ago. The company's weight loss drug Zepbound also beat estimates, booking $2.31 billion in sales for the quarter. That more than quadrupled the $517.4 million that the treatment brought in a year ago, when it had just entered the U.S. market. Analysts expected Mounjaro and Zepbound to generate $3.81 billion and $2.28 billion in sales, respectively, according to estimates from StreetAccount. Shares of Eli Lilly closed more than 11% on Thursday. That came after   on Thursday said its pharmacy benefit manager would make   Wegovy the preferred weight loss medication on its main formularies instead of Zepbound. Here's what Eli Lilly reported for the first quarter compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:  The company posted first-quarter revenue of $12.73 billion, up 45% from the same period a year ago.  Sales in the U.S. jumped 49% to $8.49 billion. Eli Lilly said that was driven by a 57% increase in volume – or the number of prescriptions or units sold – for Zepbound and Mounjaro. That was partially offset by lower realized prices of the drugs, the company said. The pharmaceutical giant booked net income of $2.76 billion, or $3.06 per share, for the first quarter. That compares with net income of $2.24 billion, or $2.48 share, a year earlier.  Excluding one-time items associated with the value of intangible assets and other adjustments, Eli Lilly posted earnings of $3.34 per share for the first quarter. Demand in the U.S. has still far outpaced supply of Zepbound and Mounjaro over the last year. Both so-called incretin treatments mimic certain gut hormones to tamp down a person's appetite and regulate their blood sugar. The popularity of those injectable drugs has forced both Eli Lilly and its rival   to invest billions to ramp up manufacturing capacity for their treatments. The efforts appear to be paying off: The Food and Drug Administration in December   to declare the U.S. shortage of tirzepatide — the active ingredient in Zepbound and Mounjaro — over.

He spoke after Eli Lilly  , which did not include estimated effects of the potential pharmaceutical tariffs. He said national security concerns around those medications are \"valid.\" But he added: \"Do I think tariffs are the answer to that? I'm not so sure personally.\" \"We would be happy to talk to this administration or national security people about how we could respond to such a crisis,\" he said. \"We have capacities to bring to bear there, and we're happy to help the country if we're in need.\" Older generic drugs account for about  prescribed in the U.S. Many are critical for hospital care, including antibiotics and vasopressors, or medications that raise blood pressure.  Ricks noted that those essential drugs are \"not easy to make, but they're cheap, and they've been driven out of our country due to cost and other damaging policies.\" However, some health experts previously told CNBC that tariffs on generic drugs, which have far lower profit margins than branded medications, could force some generic drugmakers to leave the U.S. market altogether. That could lead to or exacerbate shortages of certain generic drugs in the U.S., such as sterile injectable drugs commonly used in hospitals. Rick's comments come as drugmakers brace for President  's planned pharmaceutical tariffs, which aim to boost domestic manufacturing.

References to the insect were abundant at the company's old headquarters in London, where a picture of a cockroach was prominently displayed on the wall. For much of Hinge's 10-year history, the cockroach was the unofficial mascot. Staffers named it Flossy after the viral dance move \"the floss.\" Perez relishes the symbolism. In his determination to build a company that will push through adversity, he's encouraged employees to think of themselves like cockroaches, due to the creature's grimy resilience and noted ability to survive harsh conditions. \"It was the identity of every individual in the company,\" said Joshua Sturm, a vice president at Hinge from 2019 to 2024 and now chief revenue officer at cancer prevention startup Color Health. \"We are all in this together, and no matter what happens, we are going to survive together.\" Perez and his 1,400-person workforce now face the ultimate test of their mettle. Hinge, which moved from London to San Francisco in 2017, is trying to go public at a time of such extreme economic uncertainty and market volatility that several companies, including online lender   and ticket marketplace  , have delayed their long-awaited IPOs. Hinge filed its prospectus  , announcing plans to trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol \"HNGE.\" Three weeks later,   announced a sweeping tariff policy that plunged U.S. markets into turmoil after tariff concerns had already pushed the Nasdaq to its worst quarter since 2022. But Hinge, led by its 39-year-old co-founder and CEO, appears determined to power through the chaos. Hinge declined to comment or make Perez available for an interview.  Going public was already going to be a risky endeavor for Hinge. The IPO market has been   since late 2021, when soaring inflation and rising interest rates pushed investors out of risky assets. Within digital health, it's been almost completely dead. Health-tech companies have struggled to adapt to a more muted growth environment following the Covid pandemic, and many once promising business models haven't panned out as planned. The starkest example is virtual health company  , which has a market cap of just over $1 billion less than five years after buying digital health provider Livongo in a deal that valued the   at $37 billion. Teladoc's BetterHelp mental health unit has been a particularly troublesome business as paying users dropped off in the years following the pandemic. Over time, Hinge's Cockroach Award transitioned from a monthly prize to a quarterly distinction. The company phased it out entirely about a year ago in preparation for its next public-facing chapter, but the survive-at-all-costs mentality persists, according to current employees. Now, staffers are recognized with the \"Movers Awards,\" a nod to the company's focus on movement. \"We have many decades of work ahead,\" Perez wrote in a letter to investors in March. \"We hope you join us on this journey.\" CNBC spoke to 13 current and former Hinge employees, investors, and people close to Perez for this story, some of whom asked not to be named in order to provide candid commentary. Hinge uses software to help patients treat acute musculoskeletal injuries, chronic pain and carry out post-surgery rehabilitation remotely. Large employers like   and   cover the costs so their employees can access Hinge's app-based virtual physical therapy, as well as its wearable electrical nerve stimulation device called Enso.  The company   its technology can help users manage pain, cut down health-care costs and reduce the need for surgery and opioids. Revenue increased 33% to $390.4 million last year, while its net loss narrowed to $11.9 million from $108.1 million a year earlier, according to the prospectus. Hinge's roster of clients expanded by 36% last year to 2,256, and the number of individual members jumped 44% to over 532,300, the filing said. In an   on Monday, Hinge   revenue in its first quarter climbed 50% to $123.8 million, up from $82.7 million during the same period last year, and that net income for the period was $17.1 million compared to a loss of $26.5 million a year ago.  Hinge has raised more than $1 billion from investors including Tiger Global Management and Coatue Management, and it boasted a   as of October 2021, the last time the company raised outside funding. The biggest institutional shareholders are venture firms Insight Partners and Atomico, which own 19% and 15% of the stock, respectively, according to the filing. Perez and Gabriel Mecklenburg, Hinge's executive chairman, started the company in 2014. The pair met while they were both pursuing PhDs in the U.K. — Perez at the University of Oxford and Mecklenburg at Imperial College London. They were distracted students, according to Perez's twin brother, David.  By the time they launched Hinge, Perez and Mecklenburg had already co-founded two other ventures together. One was the Oxbridge Biotech Roundtable, an organization that connected academics and industry experts. The other was Marblar, which worked to commercialize academic intellectual property. Perez took a leave of absence from Oxford while working on Marblar and never returned. His brother wasn't a fan of the decision initially. \"I gave him terrible advice,\" said David Perez, a graduate of Yale Law School and partner at Perkins Coie in Seattle. \"I was like, 'I think you're an idiot, I think you should focus on your PhD. Only an idiot would not finish a PhD at Oxford.'\"  The twins have two older siblings. Their mother immigrated from Cuba in 1968, followed 12 years later by their father. Their parents met in Miami, got married after just three dates, and are still together after more than 40 years.  The family moved from Miami to Salt Lake City, Utah, in 1990. Perez's mother was a substitute teacher and his father worked at restaurants as a dishwasher and busboy. David Perez said their father \"worked around the clock\" and used to call out orders in his sleep.  \"It wasn't a lot of money, I think combined they made about $19,000 a year,\" David Perez said. \"But they stitched it together and raised four kids.\"  The twin boys were competitive, particularly when it came to academics and playing basketball in the driveway. David said his brother got \"great grades\" and always had an inclination toward science and medicine, graduating from high school at age 16 and then starting college at Westminster University, a small liberal arts school in Utah. \"I swear,\" David Perez said, \"there were times where the only punishment that my mom could issue that would have the sting was restricting our ability to do homework.\" Perez was a student in the Honors College at Westminster, and he graduated with a degree in biology. Richard Badenhausen, dean of the Honors College, described Perez as an independent thinker and an ambitious student, especially for his age.  \"He didn't care too much what people thought about him, which is a strength in my book,\" Badenhausen said in an interview.  When Perez was 13, he was hit by a car. He broke an arm and a leg, and had to be airlifted to a nearby hospital. After three surgeries and 12 months of rehab, he had a newfound interest in orthopedics and physical therapy.  Mecklenburg had a serious injury of his own, tearing his anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) during a judo match, which also required a year of rehab, according to Hinge's website. One day in October 2014  the pair put their heads together and outlined the tools they wished were available while undergoing physical therapy. Musculoskeletal conditions affect as many as 1.7 billion people worldwide, according to Hinge's prospectus, so there was no shortage of opportunities. They had the early concept of Hinge within hours and a prototype ready by December of that year. In Hinge's early days, Perez and Mecklenburg would meet every Saturday morning to talk shop. Now, as they've aged and started families, they meet on Wednesday nights, according to colleagues. Perez welcomed his first child with his wife late last year.  \"Seeing the growth over the last six, seven, eight years has just been unbelievable,\" said Jon Reynolds, a tech founder who contributed to Hinge's seed funding round. \"That comes down to the quality of Dan and Gabriel as leaders. They complement each other really well, and they've obviously got that mutual respect.\" Perez is a hands-on CEO who expects a lot from his staff.  He's direct, detail-oriented, opinionated, competitive and can be intense, according to current and former employees. But he's committed to the mission and the wellbeing of his employees, they said. \"He's one of those rare founder CEOs who I think can go all the way,\" said Paul Kruszewski, a former Hinge employee who joined the company after it acquired his Canadian computer vision startup, Wrnch, in 2021.  Employees say Perez is a voracious reader, often finishing two to four books a month. That includes books about business and leadership, an important source of information given that Hinge was his first real job. He's a fan of \"The Innovator's Prescription,\" by   and others, \"Crossing the Chasm,\" by Geoffrey Moore and \"The Long Fix,\" by Dr. Vivian Lee. He also likes his staffers to read. Executives will often prepare to discuss chapters from a book in their meetings.  \"I'd come home and there'd be a package from Dan, and it's a book,\" said Sturm, who led partnerships and new market development at Hinge. \"That was just the norm.\" Sturm, who has worked in the health-care and benefits space for around 30 years, said Hinge was very deliberate with hiring, so there wasn't a lot of turnover among senior executives. He said Hinge's recruitment process was the hardest he's ever experienced.  Another \"Dan-ism,\" as Sturm called it, is Hinge's philosophy around writing. Perez has employees write memos, typically up to six pages long, instead of preparing slide decks or other materials ahead of meetings. Perez was inspired by a similar practice at  , according to current and former employees, and sees it as a way to force employees to think through what they want to say instead of hiding behind bullet points. Hinge's memo culture can be an adjustment, particularly for new employees. Sturm said he thought the practice was \"insane\" at first, but ultimately came to appreciate it and said it improved his pitches. \"When you sort of sit back, you go, 'You know actually, he wasn't wrong,'\" Sturm said.  Hinge has come a long way since venture firm Atomico led the $8 million Series A investment in 2017. The London-based firm said in a   at the time that it was \"extremely impressed by Daniel and Gabriel, and their determination to tackle a big problem in society.\" Carolina Brochado led the round, though she left Atomico a year later and now works at investment firm EQT Group. She said that getting Hinge to the brink of an IPO was a \"one in a million chance,\" but noted that the company has managed to build a sizable business in digital health despite having so many odds stacked against it. \"Lots of learnings along the way, of course, like a big tech correction in the middle,\" Brochado said in an interview. \"But it really is one of those rare examples of just an enormous market that was under penetrated.\" For David Perez, whose firm now serves as Hinge's outside counsel, watching the startup grow has been \"fascinating,\" he said. \"I'm a partner at a major law firm,\" he said, \"and I am only the second most successful twin. But I think I'm okay with that.\"  ", "summary": null, "related_articles": [], "metadata": {"author": null, "publish_date": "2025-05-05T12:00:01+0000", "read_time": null, "keywords": "IPO,Teladoc Health Inc,Amazon.com Inc,Breaking News: Technology,Technology,Internet,Health care industry,Venture capital,Target Corp,Morgan Stanley,Donald J.

The company said adding Ezra's scanning technology to its platform will allow its users to screen for more conditions and access a more complete picture of their health. \"It makes so much sense,\" Jonathan Swerdlin, the co-founder and CEO of Function, said in an interview. \"What labs aren't covering, scans can see, and what scans couldn't touch on, labs cover.\" Function and Ezra declined to disclose the financial details of the acquisition.  Before Monday's announcement, Ezra's cheapest offering was a 30-minute scan that cost participants $1,495.  Ezra, founded in 2018, offers a range of full-body MRI scans that can help patients   and other conditions. The company partners with existing imaging facilities across more than 70 locations in the U.S., according to its website.  Full-body MRI scans have surged in popularity in recent years after celebrities like Kim Kardashian began posting about them on social media.

Ezra's primary competitor is  , another full-body   startup. In February, Prenuvo announced that it closed a $120 million funding round, and it also launched a new blood test to provide insights into patients' hormonal, cardiovascular, metabolic and immune health.  Ezra has raised a total of $44 million from investors, while Function has raised a total of $53 million as of June 2024.

It also directs the agency to raise inspection fees for foreign manufacturing plants, improve the enforcement of active-ingredient source reporting by overseas producers and consider publicly listing facilities that don't comply. The White House estimates that it can currently take five to 10 years to build new manufacturing capacity for pharmaceuticals, which it called \"unacceptable from a national-security standpoint.\"  \"We don't want to be buying our pharmaceuticals from other countries because if we're in a war, we're in a problem, we want to be able to make our own,\" Trump said in the fact sheet. \"As we invest in the future, we will permanently bring our medical supply chains back home.

The FDA will also ramp up inspections of foreign drug facilities, switching from announced to \"surprise\" visits overseas, he said. \"We had this crazy system in the United States where American pharma manufacturers ... are put through the ringer with inspections, and the foreign sites get a lot easier with scheduled visits, while we have surprise visits,\" Makary said. Trump's order also directs the Environmental Protection Agency to \"accelerate the construction of facilities\" related to manufacturing drugs and their ingredients.

Caremark negotiated an undisclosed lower net price for Wegovy over Zepbound on its standard formularies, offering savings on Novo Nordisk's drug to clients that opt into those plans.  But employers and unions will ultimately determine how much of those savings on Wegovy get shared with members, CVS said.  Wegovy's list price before insurance is $1,349 for a month's supply, while Zepbound's is $1,086. That decision by one of the nation's largest PBMs triggered fears of a price war in the weight loss drug market and concerns that Zepbound's sales momentum could stall. Shares of Eli Lilly plunged 11% on Thursday.  But several Wall Street analysts said the selloff was overblown. \"In our view, the Novo/CVS deal does not represent the beginning of an obesity pricing war between Lilly & Novo,\" BMO Capital Markets analyst Evan Seigerman said in a note on Thursday. He added that in discussions with the companies, both Lilly and Novo emphasized they want to expand patient access – not undercut each other on price. That may be reassuring to investors worried that a price war could hurt profit margins. But the high list price of those weight loss drugs may remain a major barrier for many patients, particularly those whose health plans don't cover the medications.  Eli Lilly told the firm it is not interested in exclusive \"one-of-one\" deals with PBMs, while Novo Nordisk said CVS approached the drugmaker about the Wegovy agreement, according to Seigerman. On an earnings call on Thursday, Eli Lilly CEO David Ricks said the company has been trying to move away from setting high list prices and paying bigger rebates to PBMs for preferential coverage. Instead, Eli Lilly is trying to set list prices closer to what it expects the plans to pay for its drugs. \"We have been very vocal about trying to move away from that,\" Ricks said, referring to deep PBM rebates.  He added that Zepbound is still growing market share.  Seigerman agreed, saying that Eli Lilly is \"continuing to perform where it matters.\" Zepbound and the company's diabetes drug Mounjaro now make up over half of U.S. GLP-1 prescriptions, outpacing the combined 46% share of Novo Nordisk's Wegovy and its diabetes treatment Ozempic, according to Seigerman.  That \"market-share traction clearly demonstrates that physicians and patients prefer Zepbound\" over Wegovy, Bernstein analyst Courtney Breen wrote in a separate note on Thursday.  It's unclear how much the CVS formulary change will appeal to employers, especially given that Zepbound is known to be more effective at promoting weight loss than Wegovy. Some patients on the standard formularies may also try to stay on their current Zepbound prescriptions by requesting exemptions, JPMorgan analyst Chris Schott said in a Thursday note.  Eli Lilly's Ricks also said CVS' move mainly affects smaller employers, who are more likely to stick with Caremark's standard formularies. Larger companies covering more patients often use customized formularies, meaning they can still decide to include Zepbound.  Regardless, the CVS-Wegovy deal overshadowed   for Eli Lilly.  The company's first-quarter revenue and earnings topped estimates on skyrocketing demand for Zepbound and Mounjaro, both of which raked in billions of dollars in sales for the period.  We'll continue to track Eli Lilly's performance in the weight loss drug market, so stay tuned!

Health-care marketplace Zocdoc has launched an artificial intelligence phone assistant that can help patients schedule appointments using conversational language. Zocdoc, founded in 2007, helps connect patients to in-network doctors and book appointments for both in person and virtual care. The company's new AI assistant, called Zo, can handle \"unlimited\" inbound calls at any hour of the day, eliminating hold times, Zocdoc said in a release.  The company said Zo can save staffers time and improve patients' experiences, which can ultimately encourage them to seek out the care they need. The assistant also serves as a major step toward what the company called its goal of aiding scheduling \"everywhere patients are seeking care.\" \"What's most exciting about Zo is that it is powered by nearly two decades of Zocdoc's expertise in facilitating patient-provider interactions, understanding complex healthcare scheduling logic, and integrating with a broad base of [electronic health records],\" Zocdoc CEO Oliver Kharraz said in a statement.  Patients can ask Zo questions like, \"Do you take my insurance?,\" or \"Do you have any offices near the West Village?,\" according to a pre-recorded demo. Health-care organizations can implement Zo without any upfront fees, long-term costs or commitments, and they don't have to be Zocdoc Marketplace customers, the company said. Providers can try out the assistant for $2 per booked appointment, but organizations that want to roll it out on a larger scale can access discounted pricing.  Zocdoc said early adopters of Zo have been able to resolve up to 70% of all scheduling calls without staff intervention. The average call lasts around two minutes and 30 seconds.  While appointment management is Zo's first use case, Zocdoc said it's exploring other applications for the assistant, including prescription refills, messaging and outbound calls like appointment reminders or last-minute openings.  Read the full announcement  .  Feel free to send any tips, suggestions, story ideas and data to Ashley at  .", "summary": null, "related_articles": [], "metadata": {"author": null, "publish_date": "2025-05-07T14:24:03+0000", "read_time": null, "keywords": "David A.

The World Health Organization says maternal mortality is unacceptably high. More than 700 women died every day in 2023 from preventable causes related to pregnancy and childbirth, according to  It's a challenge that doctors, public health authorities and community workers have been trying to tackle. Former professional soccer player Morad Fareed thinks he can make progress improving maternal health through a love of sports. Fareed's created FC Mother, a community platform pairing expectant and new mothers with a support network. The organization aims to turn global football clubs into platforms to improve public health, a broader concept he calls \"H-sports,\" or healing sports.   \"What we did was unify the world of maternal health and use football as a vehicle to distribute it, to celebrate it, and to gamify it,\" said Fareed. The organization is kicking off what it's calling the \"World Cup of Healing\" — a competition that measures health outcomes of the participating women, grouped by their reported soccer fandom.  Mothers access services and connections via the FC Mother platform and then answer regular survey questions that assess their wellbeing. Improvements fuel team progress. FC Mother has some notable buy-in from researchers at Harvard Medical School and Harvard's School of Public Health as well as team doctors from Real Madrid, Manchester United and Arsenal FC.  The initial competition launches on Sunday and runs for 60 days through the FIFA Club World Cup Final in July. This trial run pits three football clubs in Brazil and their associated fanbases of mothers against three in the United States: Mothers of San Diego FC, Mothers of Gotham FC, and Mothers of Omaha Union.  FC Mother ranked the 48 World Cup countries by maternal health outcomes based on data from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington. The institute's Global Burden of Disease report puts the United States at 44th place, lower than any other developed country in the world among that cohort based on life-years lost due to poor maternal health outcomes. Brazil ranks 46th. Team USA in the inaugural health outcomes competition is coached by Jennie Joseph the founder of Commonsense Childbirth, who was named as a woman of the year in 2022 by Time magazine for her national work as a midwife focusing on improving maternal mortality.   Fareed's goal is to gamify community maternal health via football and prove that it can increase quality-adjusted life-years (QUALYs) for both mothers and children.  A QUALY is one year of life in perfect health, a metric that's being used by major public health organizations. It's measured with a survey that asks respondents to self-report mental and emotional health, pain levels and other health domains.   While FC Mother leaves the medical treatment of pregnancy to clinicians, Fareed points to research that illustrates perinatal mental health and robust social support can generate as many as 10 additional higher-quality-of-life years for mothers and their offspring.  \"The social determinants of health are the next frontier of maternal health and public health in general,\" said Fareed. \"It's not your doctor who you're going to call. It's the community around you. It's the day-to-day interactions you have living your life that drive stress levels, mental wellbeing, emotional wellbeing.\" Just like any other sport, FC Mother's leaderboard features the stats of the competing teams, but it also offers opportunities for the users to access immediate support from other moms. Those features are available via the FC Mother App or through Meta's WhatsApp. But FC Mother isn't a charity. Fareed intends it to be a for-profit venture. He believes corporations, professional sports, family offices and donor-advised funds will be interested in investing in a platform that delivers health improvements for a fraction of the current costs of medical intervention. FC Mother hopes the kickoff competition will provide proof-of-concept and convince 40 football clubs to participate in a he maternal health outcomes competition during the World Cup in 2026.  ", "summary": null, "related_articles": [], "metadata": {"author": null, "publish_date": "2025-05-08T10:00:01+0000", "read_time": null, "keywords": "Retail industry,Sports,Social issues,business news"}, "category": "Health and Science"}
{"url": "https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/08/whoop-wearables-whoop-50-mg-price.html", "source": "cnbc", "title": "Whoop launches two new wearables with 14-day battery life", "text": [], "author": null, "timestamp": null, "tags": ["health", "science", "news", "cnbc"], "content": " on Thursday announced two new  , Whoop 5.0 and Whoop MG, which feature sleeker hardware, a longer battery life and additional in-app health insights.  Both of the company's new devices are designed for 24/7 wear.  The Whoop 5.0 and Whoop MG support 14 days of battery life, which is around triple the four-to-five-day range offered by Whoop 4.0. The new hardware is also 7% smaller than the previous device, with a processor that's 60% faster, the company said.  \"We've taken everything we've learned over the past decade and built a platform to help our members perform and live at their peak for longer,\" Whoop founder and CEO   said in a release.  The launch marks Whoop's first major hardware update since 2021, when the company released Whoop 4.0. Whoop said its new devices will help users understand how their daily decisions impact their performance and   outcomes over time, according to a release. There are three annual membership tiers: Whoop One, which costs $199 and includes the Whoop 5.0; Whoop Peak, which costs $239 and includes the Whoop 5.0; and Whoop Life, which costs $359 and includes the Whoop MG. Accessories like additional bands will come at an extra cost. Whoop 5.0 and Whoop MG memberships and accessories are available for purchase online starting on Thursday. Whoop One members will be able to use their Whoop 5.0 to measure sleep, strain and recovery, as well as the cardiovascular and muscular impact of various workouts. Users can also track their menstrual cycles and pregnancies.  Whoop Peak builds on those core metrics. Members have access to a Health Monitor feature, which provides a quick look at vitals like respiratory rate, heart rate, blood oxygen, and skin temperature. Whoop Peak also supports a real-time stress monitor, where users can see their stress level and complete guided breathing sessions if they'd like to increase relaxation or alertness.  The company also unveiled a feature called Healthspan, which uses nine metrics to calculate adult users' Whoop Age and Pace of Aging. A user's Whoop Age compares their physiological age to their actual age, and Pace of Aging assesses how fast or slow someone is aging based on their behavior.  The Healthspan feature is updated every week, and users will get tips about how they can improve their Whoop Age and Pace of Aging in their app. Whoop developed this feature in partnership with the Buck Institute for Research on Aging, the company said.  The most comprehensive membership is Whoop Life, which will give users access to additional medical-grade health features with Whoop MG.   Whoop Life members can record an electrocardiogram, or an ECG, to detect irregular heart rhythms like AFib, high heart rate or low heart rate. Once the reading is complete, they can share a PDF of the recording with their doctor.  The ECG feature has been cleared by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. It's not intended for users under 22 years old, or for users with a cardiac pacemaker or other implanted devices. It will be available in the U.S., the UAE and Qatar at launch, with additional countries coming soon.  Whoop Life members can also get daily insights about their blood pressure, including estimated systolic and diastolic ranges. Users will have to log a traditional cuff-reading to act as a baseline to unlock this feature, and it's not intended for treatment, diagnosis or medical use.   Whoop said Blood Pressure Insights has been in development for several years, and the feature is currently in beta.   I got a sneak peek at the Whoop MG, and I've been wearing it for the past few days. I can't speak to what it's like to wear the device over an extended period, but my initial experience has been largely positive.  From a hardware standpoint, the Whoop MG looks and feels sleeker than the Whoop 4.0, which I tested out in April. The actual sensor is roughly an inch wide, and the band is slightly thinner than that. I've found that both the Whoop MG and the Whoop 4.0 are a little hard to take off — you really have to tug on the latch.  The Whoop MG's setup is very straightforward, and I was up and running on the app in a matter of minutes. With all the new features, there's a lot of additional data to make sense of, so the app seemed pretty busy to me at first. I felt like I had a better handle on it after a few hours, though, and I haven't felt pressure to constantly monitor it.   Of the new features, I thought Healthspan was particularly interesting. As a relatively healthy 24-year-old, I noticed I still felt relieved to be \"younger\" than my age. I'd be curious to see how that feature would change based on my behaviors from week to week.  I also liked the Whoop MG's detailed sleep tracking and the real-time stress monitor, as stress is something I've personally been trying to be more mindful of. I've learned that my stress levels really skyrocket while I'm taking public transport, for instance, and adjust accordingly. After about a dozen tries, I wasn't able to log a successful ECG reading. I kept getting errors, even after switching wrists and the positioning of my arms. That's been disappointing, as I'm interested to see my results. The Blood Pressure Insights are neat, and assuming other users can successfully record ECG readings, it's easy to see the potential benefit. That said, I don't think I need those features in my daily life yet, so the Whoop Life membership probably wouldn't be the right pick for me.  I'm not totally sold on the Whoop MG's aesthetics. I have small hands and wrists, so I always feel like smart devices tend to look clunky on me.  I definitely felt like the Whoop 4.0 was too big for me, but the Whoop MG doesn't bother me quite as much. That's just my personal taste, and there are lots of Whoop accessories you can buy to spiff up the device for different occasions.  After just a few days, there's a lot I can still learn from the Whoop MG, but I feel like I'd personally reach for the Whoop 5.0. The range of membership options helps ensure that users don't have to break the bank, so I'd feel comfortable recommending Whoop 5.0 and Whoop MG to my friends and family. And for existing Whoop customers who are thinking about an upgrade, the extended battery life alone is worth considering.   ", "summary": null, "related_articles": [], "metadata": {"author": null, "publish_date": "2025-05-08T14:01:03+0000", "read_time": null, "keywords": "Health care industry,Internet,Technology,Breaking News: Technology,business news"}, "category": "Health and Science"}

Biden was seen by doctors last week after urinary symptoms and a prostate nodule were found. He was diagnosed with prostate cancer on Friday, with the cancer cells having spread to the bone. \"While this represents a more aggressive form of the disease, the cancer appears to be hormone-sensitive which allows for effective management,\" his office said. \"The President and his family are reviewing treatment options with his physicians.\" Prostate cancers are given a score called a Gleason score that measures, on a scale of 1 to 10, how the cancerous cells look compared with normal cells. Biden's office said his score was 9, suggesting his cancer is among the most aggressive. When prostate cancer spreads to other parts of the body, it often spreads to the bones. Metastasized cancer is much harder to treat than localized cancer because it can be hard for drugs to reach all the tumors and completely root out the disease. However, when prostate cancers need hormones to grow, as in Biden's case, they can be susceptible to treatment that deprives the tumors of hormones.

After a calamitous debate performance in June while seeking reelection, Biden abandoned his bid for a second term. Harris became the nominee and lost to Trump, a Republican who returned to the White House after a four-year hiatus. But in recent days, Biden rejected concerns about his age despite reporting in the new book \"Original Sin\" by Jake Tapper and Alex Thompson that aides had shielded the public from the extent of his decline while serving as president. In February 2023, Biden had a skin lesion removed from his chest that was a basal cell carcinoma, a common form of skin cancer.

The initiative was a continuation of his work as vice president to address a disease that had killed his older son, Beau, who died from brain cancer in 2015.

The company now expects full-year adjusted earnings of $6 to $6.20 per share, up from a previous guidance of $5.75 to $6 per share But the company revised its GAAP diluted EPS guidance to be lower, which includes charges related to a legal battle involving its pharmacy services provider subsidiary, Omnicare. A jury this week found Omnicare liable for dispensing drugs without valid prescriptions to elderly and disabled individuals in assisted living and long-term care facilities. CVS plans to appeal. The company did not provide a revenue forecast for the year. CVS said it is \"maintaining a cautious view for the remainder of the year\" in light of continued higher medical costs and \"the potential for macro headwinds.\" \"We got smarter about the markets that we wanted and the lives that we wanted to compete for, and so we actually have planned and budgeted for the elevated trends,\" CVS CEO David Joyner said in an interview with CNBC, referring to markets that the insurance unit operates in and higher medical costs \"So I think why you're not seeing a surprise on our part is because we actually plan for elevated trends going into this year,\" he added. Joyner said the company is watching for the potential impact from President  s planned tariffs on pharmaceuticals imported into the U.S. \"On the pharmacy side, I think it is highly dependent on what happens in the next week or two when they announce the implications of tariffs on the manufacturers,\" he told CNBC. Joyner added that the vast majority of the company's retail products at the front of stores are sourced in the U.S., \"which should be a benefit for us.\" Here's what CVS reported for the first quarter compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:  The company's insurer, Aetna, and its rivals have been dogged by higher-than-expected medical costs over the last year as more Medicare Advantage patients return to hospitals for procedures they delayed during the pandemic. But for the first time in several quarters, CVS' insurance business appeared to show some signs of improvement. The unit's medical benefit ratio — a measure of total medical expenses paid relative to premiums collected — decreased to 87.3% from 90.4% a year earlier. A lower ratio typically indicates that a company collected more in premiums than it paid out in benefits, resulting in higher profitability. CVS said the move partly reflects stronger underlying performance in its Medicare business and improved Medicare Advantage star ratings for the 2025 payment year. Those ratings help patients compare the quality of Medicare health and drug plans. \"I think that investment and talent that allowed us to focus on both the execution and the operation … actually helped establish the performance that you're seeing,\" Joyner said, referring to an executive reshuffling last year that tapped a new leader for the insurance unit and other parts of the business. The results cap off the second full quarter with  , a longtime CVS executive, as chief executive of the retail drugstore chain. Joyner succeeded Karen Lynch in mid-October, as CVS struggled to drive higher profits and improve its stock performance. The company underwent a management reshuffle as part of a broader turnaround plan that includes   in cost cuts over the next several years. Still, CVS' performance was partially offset by a charge of $431 million from so-called premium deficiency reserves in the insurance unit, which is related to anticipated losses in the 2025 coverage year. That refers to a liability that an insurer may need to cover if future premiums are not enough to pay for anticipated claims and expenses. The company posted net income of $1.78 billion, or $1.41 per share, for the first quarter. That compares with net income of $1.12 billion, or 88 cents per share, for the year-earlier period.  Excluding certain items, such as amortization of intangible assets, restructuring charges and capital losses, adjusted earnings were $2.25 per share for the quarter. CVS booked sales of $94.59 billion for the first quarter, up 7% from the same period a year ago due to growth across all three of its business segments.  But sales in the company's retail pharmacy segment missed Wall Street's expectations for the quarter, according to StreetAccount. That business has been pressured by softer consumer spending and lower reimbursements for prescription drugs.  CVS' insurance business booked $34.81 billion in revenue during the quarter, up 8% from the first quarter of 2024. Analysts expected the unit to take in $33.51 billion for the period, according to estimates from StreetAccount. The unit also recorded adjusted operating income of $1.99 billion for the first quarter, compared with $732 million for the year-earlier period.  Also on Thursday, CVS said Aetna will stop offering health insurance plans on the Affordable Care Act marketplaces — also known as individual exchanges — starting in the 2026 plan year. CVS' pharmacy and consumer wellness division booked $31.91 billion in sales for the first quarter, up more than 11% from the same period a year earlier. But that was far under the $35.27 billion that analysts were expecting for the quarter, according to StreetAccount. That unit dispenses prescriptions in CVS' more than 9,000 retail pharmacies and provides other pharmacy services, such as vaccinations and diagnostic testing. CVS' health services segment generated $43.46 billion in revenue for the quarter, up nearly 8% compared with the same quarter in 2024. Analysts expected the unit to post $43.64 billion in sales for the period, according to StreetAccount. That unit includes Caremark, one of the nation's largest pharmacy benefit managers.

The move is part of a new partnership between Caremark and Wegovy's manufacturer,  , according to CVS'   release. Caremark will also drop the weight loss drug Zepbound from its standard formularies on that date, in a blow to its manufacturer,  , a CVS spokesperson told CNBC. They said those standard formularies are the most common among Caremark's client base, representing tens of millions of patients. Eligible patients covered by Caremark who are currently taking Zepbound will be able to switch to Wegovy, the spokesperson said. Shares of Novo Nordisk closed around 1% lower on Thursday, while Eli Lilly's stock closed more than 11% lower.  It comes as Novo Nordisk works to boost access to Wegovy now that it is no longer in   in the U.S. Partnering with Caremark, one of the nation's largest pharmacy benefit managers, could help the drugmaker reach even more patients. Caremark discounts drugs with manufacturers on behalf of insurance plans and creates lists of medications, or formularies, that are covered by insurance and reimburses pharmacies for prescriptions. Caremark will make the drug available to its members at \"a more affordable price.\" The PBM negotiated a lower net price for Wegovy over Zepbound on its standard formularies, offering savings to clients that opt into those plans, the CVS spokesperson said. But Caremark's clients, which are employers and unions, \"individually determine how much of that savings on Wegovy gets shared with its members either via lower premiums or lower copays at the pharmacy counter,\" the spokesperson said.  Separately, any patient who does not have insurance coverage for Wegovy or another GLP-1 can still buy Novo Nordisk's drug out-of-pocket for $499 at any of CVS' 9,000 pharmacies nationwide, the spokesperson added.  In its earnings release, CVS said it is the first retail pharmacy partnering with Novo Nordisk's new direct-to-consumer online pharmacy,  , to dispense Wegovy to patients with prescriptions. NovoCare offers Wegovy at that lower price point to cash-paying patients, who may struggle to shoulder the drug's roughly $1,000 list price before insurance and other rebates. Caremark will also combine Wegovy with additional lifestyle support, such as personalized nutrition plans, as part of the CVS Weight Management program. The announcement comes as the Danish drugmaker races to capture more patients now that many compounding pharmacies are legally restricted from making cheaper, unapproved versions of Wegovy, with rare exceptions. \"It's unknown at this point how the migration from the compound pharmacies into other pharmacy settings are going to occur,\" CVS Health group president Prem Shah said on an earnings call on Thursday. \"But we do expect that there will be obviously some benefit by opening up 9,000 stores, or 9,000 opportunities for patients to be able to get the medication.\" Dave Moore, Novo Nordisk's executive vice president of U.S. operations, said in a separate release on Thursday that \"it is our responsibility to continue to work with others across the US healthcare system to find innovative opportunities to meet the needs of these patients and connect them with authentic, FDA-approved Wegovy … in a convenient and affordable way.\"", "summary": null, "related_articles": [], "metadata": {"author": null, "publish_date": "2025-05-01T10:31:30+0000", "read_time": null, "keywords": "Breaking News: Business,Health care industry,Pharmaceuticals,Biotech and Pharmaceuticals,Biotechnology,Business,CVS Health Corp,Novo Nordisk A/S,Novo Nordisk A/S,LILLY DRN,business news"}, "category": "Health and Science"}

The pharmaceutical giant now expects its adjusted fiscal 2025 earnings to come in between $20.78 and $22.28 per share, down from previous guidance of $22.50 to $24 per share. Eli Lilly said the revision reflects a $1.57 billion deal charge recorded in the first quarter, which is primarily related to its acquisition of a certain oral cancer drug from Scorpion Therapeutics. The company maintained its fiscal 2025 sales guidance of $58 billion to $61 billion. Eli Lilly said the guidance reflects President  's existing tariffs as of May 1, but does not include his planned levies on pharmaceuticals imported into the U.S. In an interview with CNBC, Eli Lilly CEO Dave Ricks said the company and other drugmakers are already announcing  , which is one of the Trump administration's stated goals of the tariffs. \"I think that actually the threat of tariffs is already bringing back critical supply chains into important industries, chips and pharma,\" Ricks said. \"So do we need to enact [tariffs?] I'm not so sure.\" He added that Eli Lilly wants to see permanently lower tax rates in the U.S., particularly 15% for domestic production. Ricks said lower taxes drove many drugmakers to manufacture in \"low-tax islands like Ireland Singapore and in Switzerland, and that can come back if there's an economic incentive.\" Eli Lilly's blockbuster diabetes treatment Mounjaro topped expectations for the first quarter, raking in $3.84 billion in revenue. That's up a whopping 113% from the same period a year ago. The company's weight loss drug Zepbound also beat estimates, booking $2.31 billion in sales for the quarter. That more than quadrupled the $517.4 million that the treatment brought in a year ago, when it had just entered the U.S. market. Analysts expected Mounjaro and Zepbound to generate $3.81 billion and $2.28 billion in sales, respectively, according to estimates from StreetAccount. Shares of Eli Lilly closed more than 11% on Thursday. That came after   on Thursday said its pharmacy benefit manager would make   Wegovy the preferred weight loss medication on its main formularies instead of Zepbound. Here's what Eli Lilly reported for the first quarter compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:  The company posted first-quarter revenue of $12.73 billion, up 45% from the same period a year ago.  Sales in the U.S. jumped 49% to $8.49 billion. Eli Lilly said that was driven by a 57% increase in volume – or the number of prescriptions or units sold – for Zepbound and Mounjaro. That was partially offset by lower realized prices of the drugs, the company said. The pharmaceutical giant booked net income of $2.76 billion, or $3.06 per share, for the first quarter. That compares with net income of $2.24 billion, or $2.48 share, a year earlier.  Excluding one-time items associated with the value of intangible assets and other adjustments, Eli Lilly posted earnings of $3.34 per share for the first quarter. Demand in the U.S. has still far outpaced supply of Zepbound and Mounjaro over the last year. Both so-called incretin treatments mimic certain gut hormones to tamp down a person's appetite and regulate their blood sugar. The popularity of those injectable drugs has forced both Eli Lilly and its rival   to invest billions to ramp up manufacturing capacity for their treatments. The efforts appear to be paying off: The Food and Drug Administration in December   to declare the U.S. shortage of tirzepatide — the active ingredient in Zepbound and Mounjaro — over. That decision effectively bars many   from marketing and selling cheaper, unapproved versions of tirzepatide.", "summary": null, "related_articles": [], "metadata": {"author": null, "publish_date": "2025-05-01T10:59:47+0000", "read_time": null, "keywords": "Breaking News: Business,Health care industry,Pharmaceuticals,Biotech and Pharmaceuticals,Biotechnology,Business,Earnings,LILLY DRN,United States,Donald Trump,Donald J.

He spoke after Eli Lilly  , which did not include estimated effects of the potential pharmaceutical tariffs. He said national security concerns around those medications are \"valid.\" But he added: \"Do I think tariffs are the answer to that? I'm not so sure personally.\" \"We would be happy to talk to this administration or national security people about how we could respond to such a crisis,\" he said. \"We have capacities to bring to bear there, and we're happy to help the country if we're in need.\" Older generic drugs account for about  prescribed in the U.S. Many are critical for hospital care, including antibiotics and vasopressors, or medications that raise blood pressure.  Ricks noted that those essential drugs are \"not easy to make, but they're cheap, and they've been driven out of our country due to cost and other damaging policies.\" However, some health experts previously told CNBC that tariffs on generic drugs, which have far lower profit margins than branded medications, could force some generic drugmakers to leave the U.S. market altogether. That could lead to or exacerbate shortages of certain generic drugs in the U.S., such as sterile injectable drugs commonly used in hospitals. Rick's comments come as drugmakers brace for President  's planned pharmaceutical tariffs, which aim to boost domestic manufacturing. Those tariff threats are already   of U.S. manufacturing investments from the pharmaceutical industry. That includes Eli Lilly, which in February announced it will   to build four new production sites in the U.S. On Thursday, Ricks said tariffs may not be needed after the industry's moves to reshore manufacturing.  \"I think that actually the threat of tariffs is already bringing back critical supply chains into important industries, chips and pharma,\" Ricks said. \"So do we need to enact [tariffs?] I'm not so sure.\" He added that Eli Lilly wants to see permanent lower tax rates in the U.S., particularly 15% for domestic production.

References to the insect were abundant at the company's old headquarters in London, where a picture of a cockroach was prominently displayed on the wall. For much of Hinge's 10-year history, the cockroach was the unofficial mascot. Staffers named it Flossy after the viral dance move \"the floss.\" Perez relishes the symbolism. In his determination to build a company that will push through adversity, he's encouraged employees to think of themselves like cockroaches, due to the creature's grimy resilience and noted ability to survive harsh conditions. \"It was the identity of every individual in the company,\" said Joshua Sturm, a vice president at Hinge from 2019 to 2024 and now chief revenue officer at cancer prevention startup Color Health. \"We are all in this together, and no matter what happens, we are going to survive together.\" Perez and his 1,400-person workforce now face the ultimate test of their mettle. Hinge, which moved from London to San Francisco in 2017, is trying to go public at a time of such extreme economic uncertainty and market volatility that several companies, including online lender   and ticket marketplace  , have delayed their long-awaited IPOs. Hinge filed its prospectus  , announcing plans to trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol \"HNGE.\" Three weeks later,   announced a sweeping tariff policy that plunged U.S. markets into turmoil after tariff concerns had already pushed the Nasdaq to its worst quarter since 2022. But Hinge, led by its 39-year-old co-founder and CEO, appears determined to power through the chaos. Hinge declined to comment or make Perez available for an interview.  Going public was already going to be a risky endeavor for Hinge. The IPO market has been   since late 2021, when soaring inflation and rising interest rates pushed investors out of risky assets. Within digital health, it's been almost completely dead. Health-tech companies have struggled to adapt to a more muted growth environment following the Covid pandemic, and many once promising business models haven't panned out as planned. The starkest example is virtual health company  , which has a market cap of just over $1 billion less than five years after buying digital health provider Livongo in a deal that valued the   at $37 billion. Teladoc's BetterHelp mental health unit has been a particularly troublesome business as paying users dropped off in the years following the pandemic. Over time, Hinge's Cockroach Award transitioned from a monthly prize to a quarterly distinction. The company phased it out entirely about a year ago in preparation for its next public-facing chapter, but the survive-at-all-costs mentality persists, according to current employees. Now, staffers are recognized with the \"Movers Awards,\" a nod to the company's focus on movement. \"We have many decades of work ahead,\" Perez wrote in a letter to investors in March. \"We hope you join us on this journey.\" CNBC spoke to 13 current and former Hinge employees, investors, and people close to Perez for this story, some of whom asked not to be named in order to provide candid commentary. Hinge uses software to help patients treat acute musculoskeletal injuries, chronic pain and carry out post-surgery rehabilitation remotely. Large employers like   and   cover the costs so their employees can access Hinge's app-based virtual physical therapy, as well as its wearable electrical nerve stimulation device called Enso.  The company   its technology can help users manage pain, cut down health-care costs and reduce the need for surgery and opioids. Revenue increased 33% to $390.4 million last year, while its net loss narrowed to $11.9 million from $108.1 million a year earlier, according to the prospectus. Hinge's roster of clients expanded by 36% last year to 2,256, and the number of individual members jumped 44% to over 532,300, the filing said. In an   on Monday, Hinge   revenue in its first quarter climbed 50% to $123.8 million, up from $82.7 million during the same period last year, and that net income for the period was $17.1 million compared to a loss of $26.5 million a year ago.  Hinge has raised more than $1 billion from investors including Tiger Global Management and Coatue Management, and it boasted a   as of October 2021, the last time the company raised outside funding. The biggest institutional shareholders are venture firms Insight Partners and Atomico, which own 19% and 15% of the stock, respectively, according to the filing. Perez and Gabriel Mecklenburg, Hinge's executive chairman, started the company in 2014. The pair met while they were both pursuing PhDs in the U.K. — Perez at the University of Oxford and Mecklenburg at Imperial College London. They were distracted students, according to Perez's twin brother, David.  By the time they launched Hinge, Perez and Mecklenburg had already co-founded two other ventures together. One was the Oxbridge Biotech Roundtable, an organization that connected academics and industry experts. The other was Marblar, which worked to commercialize academic intellectual property. Perez took a leave of absence from Oxford while working on Marblar and never returned. His brother wasn't a fan of the decision initially. \"I gave him terrible advice,\" said David Perez, a graduate of Yale Law School and partner at Perkins Coie in Seattle. \"I was like, 'I think you're an idiot, I think you should focus on your PhD. Only an idiot would not finish a PhD at Oxford.'\"  The twins have two older siblings. Their mother immigrated from Cuba in 1968, followed 12 years later by their father. Their parents met in Miami, got married after just three dates, and are still together after more than 40 years.  The family moved from Miami to Salt Lake City, Utah, in 1990. Perez's mother was a substitute teacher and his father worked at restaurants as a dishwasher and busboy. David Perez said their father \"worked around the clock\" and used to call out orders in his sleep.  \"It wasn't a lot of money, I think combined they made about $19,000 a year,\" David Perez said. \"But they stitched it together and raised four kids.\"  The twin boys were competitive, particularly when it came to academics and playing basketball in the driveway. David said his brother got \"great grades\" and always had an inclination toward science and medicine, graduating from high school at age 16 and then starting college at Westminster University, a small liberal arts school in Utah. \"I swear,\" David Perez said, \"there were times where the only punishment that my mom could issue that would have the sting was restricting our ability to do homework.\" Perez was a student in the Honors College at Westminster, and he graduated with a degree in biology. Richard Badenhausen, dean of the Honors College, described Perez as an independent thinker and an ambitious student, especially for his age.  \"He didn't care too much what people thought about him, which is a strength in my book,\" Badenhausen said in an interview.  When Perez was 13, he was hit by a car. He broke an arm and a leg, and had to be airlifted to a nearby hospital. After three surgeries and 12 months of rehab, he had a newfound interest in orthopedics and physical therapy.  Mecklenburg had a serious injury of his own, tearing his anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) during a judo match, which also required a year of rehab, according to Hinge's website. One day in October 2014  the pair put their heads together and outlined the tools they wished were available while undergoing physical therapy. Musculoskeletal conditions affect as many as 1.7 billion people worldwide, according to Hinge's prospectus, so there was no shortage of opportunities. They had the early concept of Hinge within hours and a prototype ready by December of that year. In Hinge's early days, Perez and Mecklenburg would meet every Saturday morning to talk shop. Now, as they've aged and started families, they meet on Wednesday nights, according to colleagues. Perez welcomed his first child with his wife late last year.  \"Seeing the growth over the last six, seven, eight years has just been unbelievable,\" said Jon Reynolds, a tech founder who contributed to Hinge's seed funding round. \"That comes down to the quality of Dan and Gabriel as leaders. They complement each other really well, and they've obviously got that mutual respect.\" Perez is a hands-on CEO who expects a lot from his staff.  He's direct, detail-oriented, opinionated, competitive and can be intense, according to current and former employees. But he's committed to the mission and the wellbeing of his employees, they said. \"He's one of those rare founder CEOs who I think can go all the way,\" said Paul Kruszewski, a former Hinge employee who joined the company after it acquired his Canadian computer vision startup, Wrnch, in 2021.  Employees say Perez is a voracious reader, often finishing two to four books a month. That includes books about business and leadership, an important source of information given that Hinge was his first real job. He's a fan of \"The Innovator's Prescription,\" by   and others, \"Crossing the Chasm,\" by Geoffrey Moore and \"The Long Fix,\" by Dr. Vivian Lee. He also likes his staffers to read. Executives will often prepare to discuss chapters from a book in their meetings.  \"I'd come home and there'd be a package from Dan, and it's a book,\" said Sturm, who led partnerships and new market development at Hinge. \"That was just the norm.\" Sturm, who has worked in the health-care and benefits space for around 30 years, said Hinge was very deliberate with hiring, so there wasn't a lot of turnover among senior executives. He said Hinge's recruitment process was the hardest he's ever experienced.  Another \"Dan-ism,\" as Sturm called it, is Hinge's philosophy around writing. Perez has employees write memos, typically up to six pages long, instead of preparing slide decks or other materials ahead of meetings. Perez was inspired by a similar practice at  , according to current and former employees, and sees it as a way to force employees to think through what they want to say instead of hiding behind bullet points. Hinge's memo culture can be an adjustment, particularly for new employees. Sturm said he thought the practice was \"insane\" at first, but ultimately came to appreciate it and said it improved his pitches. \"When you sort of sit back, you go, 'You know actually, he wasn't wrong,'\" Sturm said.  Hinge has come a long way since venture firm Atomico led the $8 million Series A investment in 2017. The London-based firm said in a   at the time that it was \"extremely impressed by Daniel and Gabriel, and their determination to tackle a big problem in society.\" Carolina Brochado led the round, though she left Atomico a year later and now works at investment firm EQT Group. She said that getting Hinge to the brink of an IPO was a \"one in a million chance,\" but noted that the company has managed to build a sizable business in digital health despite having so many odds stacked against it. \"Lots of learnings along the way, of course, like a big tech correction in the middle,\" Brochado said in an interview. \"But it really is one of those rare examples of just an enormous market that was under penetrated.\" For David Perez, whose firm now serves as Hinge's outside counsel, watching the startup grow has been \"fascinating,\" he said. \"I'm a partner at a major law firm,\" he said, \"and I am only the second most successful twin. But I think I'm okay with that.\"  ", "summary": null, "related_articles": [], "metadata": {"author": null, "publish_date": "2025-05-05T12:00:01+0000", "read_time": null, "keywords": "IPO,Teladoc Health Inc,Amazon.com Inc,Breaking News: Technology,Technology,Internet,Health care industry,Venture capital,Target Corp,Morgan Stanley,Donald J.

The company partners with existing imaging facilities across more than 70 locations in the U.S., according to its website.  Full-body MRI scans have surged in popularity in recent years after celebrities like Kim Kardashian began posting about them on social media.

The order directs the Food and Drug Administration to reduce the amount of time it takes to approve manufacturing plants in the U.S. by eliminating unnecessary requirements, streamlining reviews and working with domestic drugmakers to \"provide early support before facilities come online,\" according to  . It also directs the agency to raise inspection fees for foreign manufacturing plants, improve the enforcement of active-ingredient source reporting by overseas producers and consider publicly listing facilities that don't comply. The White House estimates that it can currently take five to 10 years to build new manufacturing capacity for pharmaceuticals, which it called \"unacceptable from a national-security standpoint.\"  \"We don't want to be buying our pharmaceuticals from other countries because if we're in a war, we're in a problem, we want to be able to make our own,\" Trump said in the fact sheet. \"As we invest in the future, we will permanently bring our medical supply chains back home. We will produce our medical supplies, pharmaceuticals, and treatments right here in the United States.\" The order will allow the FDA to conduct more inspections of new manufacturing sites with the same resources, the agency's commissioner, Marty Makary, told reporters on Monday. The FDA will also ramp up inspections of foreign drug facilities, switching from announced to \"surprise\" visits overseas, he said. \"We had this crazy system in the United States where American pharma manufacturers ... are put through the ringer with inspections, and the foreign sites get a lot easier with scheduled visits, while we have surprise visits,\" Makary said.

Caremark negotiated an undisclosed lower net price for Wegovy over Zepbound on its standard formularies, offering savings on Novo Nordisk's drug to clients that opt into those plans.  But employers and unions will ultimately determine how much of those savings on Wegovy get shared with members, CVS said.  Wegovy's list price before insurance is $1,349 for a month's supply, while Zepbound's is $1,086. That decision by one of the nation's largest PBMs triggered fears of a price war in the weight loss drug market and concerns that Zepbound's sales momentum could stall. Shares of Eli Lilly plunged 11% on Thursday.  But several Wall Street analysts said the selloff was overblown. \"In our view, the Novo/CVS deal does not represent the beginning of an obesity pricing war between Lilly & Novo,\" BMO Capital Markets analyst Evan Seigerman said in a note on Thursday. He added that in discussions with the companies, both Lilly and Novo emphasized they want to expand patient access – not undercut each other on price. That may be reassuring to investors worried that a price war could hurt profit margins. But the high list price of those weight loss drugs may remain a major barrier for many patients, particularly those whose health plans don't cover the medications.  Eli Lilly told the firm it is not interested in exclusive \"one-of-one\" deals with PBMs, while Novo Nordisk said CVS approached the drugmaker about the Wegovy agreement, according to Seigerman. On an earnings call on Thursday, Eli Lilly CEO David Ricks said the company has been trying to move away from setting high list prices and paying bigger rebates to PBMs for preferential coverage. Instead, Eli Lilly is trying to set list prices closer to what it expects the plans to pay for its drugs. \"We have been very vocal about trying to move away from that,\" Ricks said, referring to deep PBM rebates.  He added that Zepbound is still growing market share.  Seigerman agreed, saying that Eli Lilly is \"continuing to perform where it matters.\" Zepbound and the company's diabetes drug Mounjaro now make up over half of U.S. GLP-1 prescriptions, outpacing the combined 46% share of Novo Nordisk's Wegovy and its diabetes treatment Ozempic, according to Seigerman.  That \"market-share traction clearly demonstrates that physicians and patients prefer Zepbound\" over Wegovy, Bernstein analyst Courtney Breen wrote in a separate note on Thursday.  It's unclear how much the CVS formulary change will appeal to employers, especially given that Zepbound is known to be more effective at promoting weight loss than Wegovy. Some patients on the standard formularies may also try to stay on their current Zepbound prescriptions by requesting exemptions, JPMorgan analyst Chris Schott said in a Thursday note.  Eli Lilly's Ricks also said CVS' move mainly affects smaller employers, who are more likely to stick with Caremark's standard formularies. Larger companies covering more patients often use customized formularies, meaning they can still decide to include Zepbound.  Regardless, the CVS-Wegovy deal overshadowed   for Eli Lilly.  The company's first-quarter revenue and earnings topped estimates on skyrocketing demand for Zepbound and Mounjaro, both of which raked in billions of dollars in sales for the period.  We'll continue to track Eli Lilly's performance in the weight loss drug market, so stay tuned!

Health-care marketplace Zocdoc has launched an artificial intelligence phone assistant that can help patients schedule appointments using conversational language. Zocdoc, founded in 2007, helps connect patients to in-network doctors and book appointments for both in person and virtual care. The company's new AI assistant, called Zo, can handle \"unlimited\" inbound calls at any hour of the day, eliminating hold times, Zocdoc said in a release.  The company said Zo can save staffers time and improve patients' experiences, which can ultimately encourage them to seek out the care they need. The assistant also serves as a major step toward what the company called its goal of aiding scheduling \"everywhere patients are seeking care.\" \"What's most exciting about Zo is that it is powered by nearly two decades of Zocdoc's expertise in facilitating patient-provider interactions, understanding complex healthcare scheduling logic, and integrating with a broad base of [electronic health records],\" Zocdoc CEO Oliver Kharraz said in a statement.  Patients can ask Zo questions like, \"Do you take my insurance?,\" or \"Do you have any offices near the West Village?,\" according to a pre-recorded demo. Health-care organizations can implement Zo without any upfront fees, long-term costs or commitments, and they don't have to be Zocdoc Marketplace customers, the company said. Providers can try out the assistant for $2 per booked appointment, but organizations that want to roll it out on a larger scale can access discounted pricing.  Zocdoc said early adopters of Zo have been able to resolve up to 70% of all scheduling calls without staff intervention. The average call lasts around two minutes and 30 seconds.  While appointment management is Zo's first use case, Zocdoc said it's exploring other applications for the assistant, including prescription refills, messaging and outbound calls like appointment reminders or last-minute openings.  Read the full announcement  .  Feel free to send any tips, suggestions, story ideas and data to Ashley at  .", "summary": null, "related_articles": [], "metadata": {"author": null, "publish_date": "2025-05-07T14:24:03+0000", "read_time": null, "keywords": "David A.

The World Health Organization says maternal mortality is unacceptably high. More than 700 women died every day in 2023 from preventable causes related to pregnancy and childbirth, according to  It's a challenge that doctors, public health authorities and community workers have been trying to tackle. Former professional soccer player Morad Fareed thinks he can make progress improving maternal health through a love of sports. Fareed's created FC Mother, a community platform pairing expectant and new mothers with a support network. The organization aims to turn global football clubs into platforms to improve public health, a broader concept he calls \"H-sports,\" or healing sports.   \"What we did was unify the world of maternal health and use football as a vehicle to distribute it, to celebrate it, and to gamify it,\" said Fareed. The organization is kicking off what it's calling the \"World Cup of Healing\" — a competition that measures health outcomes of the participating women, grouped by their reported soccer fandom.  Mothers access services and connections via the FC Mother platform and then answer regular survey questions that assess their wellbeing. Improvements fuel team progress. FC Mother has some notable buy-in from researchers at Harvard Medical School and Harvard's School of Public Health as well as team doctors from Real Madrid, Manchester United and Arsenal FC.  The initial competition launches on Sunday and runs for 60 days through the FIFA Club World Cup Final in July. This trial run pits three football clubs in Brazil and their associated fanbases of mothers against three in the United States: Mothers of San Diego FC, Mothers of Gotham FC, and Mothers of Omaha Union.  FC Mother ranked the 48 World Cup countries by maternal health outcomes based on data from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington. The institute's Global Burden of Disease report puts the United States at 44th place, lower than any other developed country in the world among that cohort based on life-years lost due to poor maternal health outcomes. Brazil ranks 46th. Team USA in the inaugural health outcomes competition is coached by Jennie Joseph the founder of Commonsense Childbirth, who was named as a woman of the year in 2022 by Time magazine for her national work as a midwife focusing on improving maternal mortality.   Fareed's goal is to gamify community maternal health via football and prove that it can increase quality-adjusted life-years (QUALYs) for both mothers and children.  A QUALY is one year of life in perfect health, a metric that's being used by major public health organizations. It's measured with a survey that asks respondents to self-report mental and emotional health, pain levels and other health domains.   While FC Mother leaves the medical treatment of pregnancy to clinicians, Fareed points to research that illustrates perinatal mental health and robust social support can generate as many as 10 additional higher-quality-of-life years for mothers and their offspring.  \"The social determinants of health are the next frontier of maternal health and public health in general,\" said Fareed. \"It's not your doctor who you're going to call. It's the community around you. It's the day-to-day interactions you have living your life that drive stress levels, mental wellbeing, emotional wellbeing.\" Just like any other sport, FC Mother's leaderboard features the stats of the competing teams, but it also offers opportunities for the users to access immediate support from other moms. Those features are available via the FC Mother App or through Meta's WhatsApp. But FC Mother isn't a charity. Fareed intends it to be a for-profit venture. He believes corporations, professional sports, family offices and donor-advised funds will be interested in investing in a platform that delivers health improvements for a fraction of the current costs of medical intervention. FC Mother hopes the kickoff competition will provide proof-of-concept and convince 40 football clubs to participate in a he maternal health outcomes competition during the World Cup in 2026.  ", "summary": null, "related_articles": [], "metadata": {"author": null, "publish_date": "2025-05-08T10:00:01+0000", "read_time": null, "keywords": "Retail industry,Sports,Social issues,business news"}, "category": "Health and Science"}

The Whoop 5.0 and Whoop MG support 14 days of battery life, which is around triple the four-to-five-day range offered by Whoop 4.0. The new hardware is also 7% smaller than the previous device, with a processor that's 60% faster, the company said.  \"We've taken everything we've learned over the past decade and built a platform to help our members perform and live at their peak for longer,\" Whoop founder and CEO   said in a release.  The launch marks Whoop's first major hardware update since 2021, when the company released Whoop 4.0. Whoop said its new devices will help users understand how their daily decisions impact their performance and   outcomes over time, according to a release. There are three annual membership tiers: Whoop One, which costs $199 and includes the Whoop 5.0; Whoop Peak, which costs $239 and includes the Whoop 5.0; and Whoop Life, which costs $359 and includes the Whoop MG. Accessories like additional bands will come at an extra cost. Whoop 5.0 and Whoop MG memberships and accessories are available for purchase online starting on Thursday. Whoop One members will be able to use their Whoop 5.0 to measure sleep, strain and recovery, as well as the cardiovascular and muscular impact of various workouts. Users can also track their menstrual cycles and pregnancies.  Whoop Peak builds on those core metrics. Members have access to a Health Monitor feature, which provides a quick look at vitals like respiratory rate, heart rate, blood oxygen, and skin temperature. Whoop Peak also supports a real-time stress monitor, where users can see their stress level and complete guided breathing sessions if they'd like to increase relaxation or alertness.  The company also unveiled a feature called Healthspan, which uses nine metrics to calculate adult users' Whoop Age and Pace of Aging. A user's Whoop Age compares their physiological age to their actual age, and Pace of Aging assesses how fast or slow someone is aging based on their behavior.  The Healthspan feature is updated every week, and users will get tips about how they can improve their Whoop Age and Pace of Aging in their app. Whoop developed this feature in partnership with the Buck Institute for Research on Aging, the company said.  The most comprehensive membership is Whoop Life, which will give users access to additional medical-grade health features with Whoop MG.   Whoop Life members can record an electrocardiogram, or an ECG, to detect irregular heart rhythms like AFib, high heart rate or low heart rate. Once the reading is complete, they can share a PDF of the recording with their doctor.  The ECG feature has been cleared by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. It's not intended for users under 22 years old, or for users with a cardiac pacemaker or other implanted devices. It will be available in the U.S., the UAE and Qatar at launch, with additional countries coming soon.  Whoop Life members can also get daily insights about their blood pressure, including estimated systolic and diastolic ranges. Users will have to log a traditional cuff-reading to act as a baseline to unlock this feature, and it's not intended for treatment, diagnosis or medical use.   Whoop said Blood Pressure Insights has been in development for several years, and the feature is currently in beta.   I got a sneak peek at the Whoop MG, and I've been wearing it for the past few days. I can't speak to what it's like to wear the device over an extended period, but my initial experience has been largely positive.  From a hardware standpoint, the Whoop MG looks and feels sleeker than the Whoop 4.0, which I tested out in April. The actual sensor is roughly an inch wide, and the band is slightly thinner than that. I've found that both the Whoop MG and the Whoop 4.0 are a little hard to take off — you really have to tug on the latch.  The Whoop MG's setup is very straightforward, and I was up and running on the app in a matter of minutes. With all the new features, there's a lot of additional data to make sense of, so the app seemed pretty busy to me at first. I felt like I had a better handle on it after a few hours, though, and I haven't felt pressure to constantly monitor it.   Of the new features, I thought Healthspan was particularly interesting. As a relatively healthy 24-year-old, I noticed I still felt relieved to be \"younger\" than my age. I'd be curious to see how that feature would change based on my behaviors from week to week.  I also liked the Whoop MG's detailed sleep tracking and the real-time stress monitor, as stress is something I've personally been trying to be more mindful of. I've learned that my stress levels really skyrocket while I'm taking public transport, for instance, and adjust accordingly. After about a dozen tries, I wasn't able to log a successful ECG reading. I kept getting errors, even after switching wrists and the positioning of my arms. That's been disappointing, as I'm interested to see my results. The Blood Pressure Insights are neat, and assuming other users can successfully record ECG readings, it's easy to see the potential benefit. That said, I don't think I need those features in my daily life yet, so the Whoop Life membership probably wouldn't be the right pick for me.  I'm not totally sold on the Whoop MG's aesthetics. I have small hands and wrists, so I always feel like smart devices tend to look clunky on me.  I definitely felt like the Whoop 4.0 was too big for me, but the Whoop MG doesn't bother me quite as much. That's just my personal taste, and there are lots of Whoop accessories you can buy to spiff up the device for different occasions.  After just a few days, there's a lot I can still learn from the Whoop MG, but I feel like I'd personally reach for the Whoop 5.0. The range of membership options helps ensure that users don't have to break the bank, so I'd feel comfortable recommending Whoop 5.0 and Whoop MG to my friends and family. And for existing Whoop customers who are thinking about an upgrade, the extended battery life alone is worth considering.   ", "summary": null, "related_articles": [], "metadata": {"author": null, "publish_date": "2025-05-08T14:01:03+0000", "read_time": null, "keywords": "Health care industry,Internet,Technology,Breaking News: Technology,business news"}, "category": "Health and Science"}

The company began developing the prototype for its Teal Wand just over five years ago. The concept was to make cervical cancer screening more accessible via telehealth and a test that could be self-administered at home, rather than at a doctor's office. \"The pandemic showed everyone that telehealth is a thing that is preferred … and made it easier to get care for most Americans,\" said Kara Egan, CEO of Teal Health, adding that Covid also demonstrated \"at-home testing was a thing that people could handle and really understand.\" The Teal Wand works much like a tampon applicator, with a large swab that the user can insert themselves to collect a sample for testing. The FDA designated the tool as a breakthrough device after the company's clinical trial results showed the precision of the self-administered test was comparable with an in-office screening performed by a clinician, with a 96% accuracy rate. Teal plans to make the wand available in California first, starting in June. The company has had discussions with carriers about insurance coverage for the test as a preventive screening, which for most women would be covered without copays just like an annual doctor's visit. The American Cancer Society recommends women get screened for cervical cancer every three years starting at age 21. Yet Egan says 1 in 4 women fall behind on screening, in part because they can't find time for an in-person gynecologist appointment, a problem especially for women in rural areas who often have to travel beyond their community to get to a doctor.   \"This is about increasing access to care and making sure we have more options to get that care,\" she said. Ahead of its anticipated FDA approval, Teal Health raised $10 million in its latest funding round in January to help ramp up production for the launch of the Teal Wand. The investment was led by Forerunner Ventures and Laurene Powell Jobs' Emerson Collective. The company has raised a total of $23 million from investors including Serena Williams' Serena Ventures, as well as testing firm LabCorp.   The company's milestone comes as investors have grown more interested in women's health tech. Last year, there was an influx of $680 million into the space invested across 30 deals, according to data from Deloitte. About 60% of those funds went to later-stage investments, according to Jen Radin, principal in Deloitte's life sciences and health-care practice. \"From 2023 to 2024 femtech saw 41% growth, outpacing overall health tech, which grew only 10%,\" Radin said. FemHealth Ventures managing partner Maneesha Ghiya says while investors are now more cautious, in general, interest in women's health tech is moving beyond maternity and menopause.    \"Many more people are thinking about women's health more broadly and supporting these types of innovations — and that includes from the large, established players like medtech, pharma, biotech, large public companies that are thinking more broadly about women's health,\" Ghiya said.", "summary": null, "related_articles": [], "metadata": {"author": null, "publish_date": "2025-05-09T14:24:21+0000", "read_time": null, "keywords": "Business,Health care industry,Social issues,San Francisco,business news"}, "category": "Health and Science"}

Fewer prescription fills would allow employees to interact directly with patients and perform more clinical services such as vaccinations and testing. Walgreens first rolled out the robot-powered centers in 2021, but paused expansion in 2023 to focus on gathering feedback and improving performance at existing sites. After more than a year of making upgrades, including new internal tools, the company said it is ready to expand the reach of that technology again. Walgreens told CNBC it hopes to have its 11 micro-fulfillment centers serve more than 5,000 stores by the end of the year, up from 4,800 in February and 4,300 in October 2023. As of February, the centers handled 40% of the prescription volume on average at supported pharmacies, according to Walgreens.  That translates to around 16 million prescriptions filled each month across the different sites, the company said.  The renewed automation push comes as Walgreens prepares to go private in a roughly   with Sycamore Partners, expected to close by the end of the year.  The deal would cap a turbulent chapter for Walgreens as a public company, marked by a rocky transition out of the pandemic, declining pharmacy reimbursement rates, weaker consumer spending and fierce competition from  ,   and other retail giants. Like CVS, Walgreens has shifted from opening new stores to closing hundreds of underperforming locations to shore up profits. Both companies are racing to stay relevant as online retailers lure away customers and patients increasingly opt for fast home delivery over traditional pharmacy visits. The changes also follow mounting discontent among pharmacy staff: In 2023, nationwide walkouts spotlighted burnout and chronic understaffing, forcing chains to reexamine their operational models. Walgreens said the investment in robotic pharmacy fills is already paying off. To date, micro-fulfillment centers have generated approximately $500 million in savings by cutting excess inventory and boosting efficiency, said Kayla Heffington, Walgreens' pharmacy operating model vice president. Heffington added that stores using the facilities are administering 40% more vaccines than those that aren't.  \"Right now, they're the backbone to really help us offset some of the workload in our stores, to obviously allow more time for our pharmacists and technicians to spend time with patients,\" said Rick Gates, Walgreens' chief pharmacy officer. \"It gives us a lot more flexibility to bring down costs, to increase the care and increase speed to therapy – all those things,\" he said.  Gates added that the centers give Walgreens a competitive advantage because independent pharmacies and some rivals don't have centralized support for their stores. Still,  ,   and   have similarly tested or   their own micro-fulfillment facilities to dispense grocery items and other prescriptions.  Micro-fulfillment centers come with their own risks, such as a heavy reliance on sophisticated robotics that can cause disruptions if errors occur. But the facilities are becoming a permanent fixture in retail due to the cost savings they offer and their ability to streamline workflows, reduce the burden on employees and deliver goods to customers faster. When a Walgreens retail pharmacy receives a prescription, the system determines whether it should be filled at that location or routed to a nearby micro-fulfillment center. Maintenance medications, or prescription drugs taken regularly to manage chronic health conditions, and refills that don't require immediate pickup are often sent to micro-fulfillment. At the core of each facility is a highly automated system that uses robotics, conveyor belts and barcode scanners, among other tools, to fill prescriptions. The operations are supported by a team of pharmacists pharmacy technicians and other professionals. Instead of staff members filling prescriptions by hand at stores, pill bottles move through an automated and carefully choreographed assembly line.  Pharmacy technicians fill canisters with medications for robot pods to dispense, and pharmacists verify those canisters to make sure they are accurate. Yellow robotic arms grab a labeled prescription vial and hold it up to a canister, which precisely dispenses the specific medication for that bottle. Certain prescriptions are filled at separate manual stations, including inhalers and birth control pill packs. Each prescription is then sorted and packaged for delivery back to retail pharmacy locations for final pickup. There are other security and safety measures throughout the process, said Ahlam Antar, registered group supervisor of a micro-fulfillment center in Mansfield, Massachusetts.  For example, the robot pods automatically lock and signal an error with a red-orange light if a worker attaches a canister to the wrong dispenser, preventing the incorrect pills from going in a prescription, she said.  Properly training workers at the centers to ensure accuracy and patient safety is also crucial, according to Sarah Gonsalves, a senior certified pharmacy technician at the Mansfield site.  She said a core part of her role is to make sure that technicians can correctly perform the different tasks in the process.  Antar, who has worked at the Mansfield site since its 2022 opening, said Walgreens has made improvements to the micro-fulfillment process after considering feedback from stores and patients during the paused expansion. That includes establishing new roles needed to support the process at the sites, such as a training manager for all 11 locations.  The facilities also plan to transition to using smaller prescription vials after hearing concerns that the current bottles are too large, according to a Walgreens spokesperson. They said that will allow the centers to ship more prescriptions per order and reduce costs. Heffington said the automated locations have helped reduce Walgreens' overall prescription fulfillment costs by nearly 13% compared to a year ago.  She said Walgreens has also increased prescription volume by 126% year-over-year, now filling more than 170 million prescriptions annually. The company hopes to raise that number to 180 million or even more.  Heffington added that Walgreens implemented new internal tools to track the work across all 11 centers and provide real-time data on where a patient's prescription is in the micro-fulfillment process.  \"If a patient called the store and said, 'Hey, can you tell me where my prescription is today?' [Workers] can do that with great specificity,\" thanks to the new tools, Heffington said.  Despite the company's progress, Gates said there is more work to be done with micro-fulfillment centers.  For example, he pointed to the possibility of shipping prescriptions directly to patients' doorsteps instead of putting that burden on retail stores.  \"It's only step one right now,\" he said.  Other improvements may still be needed at facilities, according to some reports. For example, WRAL News   in April that some customers at a Walgreens store in Garner, North Carolina, say they are only getting partial prescription fills, with several pills missing, or their medicine is being delayed. Before Brian Gange's Arizona store started relying on an automated facility, he walked into the pharmacy every morning knowing that a massive list of prescriptions was in his work queue waiting to be filled for the day.  Now, with help from micro-fulfillment, that list is significantly smaller each day, according to Gange.  \"We don't have to spend as much time on just those repetitive fulfillment tasks,\" he told CNBC. \"It really takes a huge weight off our shoulders.\"  Gange said that gives him and his team time to step behind the pharmacy counter and interact with customers face-to-face, answering questions, providing advice, performing health tests or administering vaccines.  That kind of attention can make all the difference for a patient.   For example, Gange recalls stepping away for five minutes to take a patient's blood pressure despite being overwhelmed with tasks while working at a different Walgreens location several years ago. He ended up sending that person to the emergency room because their blood pressure was \"off the charts.\"  That patient's wife visited the pharmacy the next day to thank Gange, saying her husband \"probably wouldn't be here with us today\" without that blood pressure test.  \"I shouldn't have to question whether I have that five or 10 minutes to check a blood pressure for a patient,\" Gange said. \"Micro-fulfillment and centralized services are really what are going to allow us to be able to do that, to have that time.\"  \"That really allows us to provide better care for them,\" he added.", "summary": null, "related_articles": [], "metadata": {"author": null, "publish_date": "2025-05-11T12:00:01+0000", "read_time": null, "keywords": "Breaking News: Business,Health care industry,Pharmaceuticals,Biotech and Pharmaceuticals,Biotechnology,Business,Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc,CVS Health Corp,Amazon.com Inc,Walmart Inc,Kroger Co,Albertsons Companies Inc,Rick Gates,Mansfield,North Carolina,business news"}, "category": "Health and Science"}

Trump signed an executive order including several different actions to renew that effort, known as the \"most favored nation\" policy. He did not refer to specific nations, but signaled that he would target other developed countries because \"there are some countries that need some additional help, and that's fine.\" \"Basically, what we're doing is equalizing,\" Trump said during a press event on Monday. \"We are going to pay the lowest price there is in the world. We will get whoever is paying the lowest price, that's the price that we're going to get.\" White House officials did not disclose which medications the order will apply to, but said it will impact the commercial market as well as Medicare and Medicaid. They said Monday's announcement will be broader than a similar policy that Trump tried to push during his first term, which only applied to Medicare Part B drugs. Officials added that the administration will have a particular focus on drugs that have the \"largest disparities and largest expenditures,\" which could include popular weight loss and diabetes treatments called GLP-1 drugs. It's unclear how effective the policy will be at lowering costs for patients. In a social media post on Monday, Trump claimed drug prices will be cut by \"59%, PLUS!\" But Trump during the press event claimed drug prices may fall even more, between 59% and 80%, or \"I guess even 90%.\" Some Wall Street analysts and other experts also questioned whether the policy can be implemented. In a note on Monday, JPMorgan analysts called the policy \"challenging to practically implement\" because it would likely require congressional approval and could run into legal hurdles. It is Trump's latest effort to try to rein in U.S. prescription drug prices, which are   in other developed nations – and up to 10 times more than in certain countries, according to the Rand Corp., a public policy think tank. In a statement on Monday, the pharmaceutical industry's biggest lobbying group, PhRMA, lauded Trump for taking aim at other nations \"not paying their fair share.\"  Still, PhRMA's CEO Stephen Ubl said \"importing foreign prices from socialist countries would be a bad deal for American patients and workers\" because it would hurt the industry's ability to bring them new treatments. Some experts have said the order could face challenges from the pharmaceutical industry in court. Despite the order, shares of U.S. drugmakers rose Monday.  's stock added more than 4%, while   and   climbed more than 2% AARP, which advocates for older Americans, thanked Trump for issuing the order in a statement on Monday.  \"For too long, big drug companies have been ripping off America's seniors—charging the highest prices in the world for lifesaving prescriptions, padding their profits at the expense of American lives, and forcing older adults to skip medications they can't afford,\" AARP's chief advocacy and engagement officer Nancy LeaMond said in the statement. Part of the order takes aim at nations abroad, which have more power to negotiate down drug prices with pharmaceutical companies. \"Starting today, the United States will no longer subsidize the health care of foreign countries, which is what we were doing,\" Trump said, adding the U.S. \"will no longer tolerate profiteering and price gouging from Big Pharma.\" He added that \"it was really the countries that forced Big Pharma to do things that, frankly, I'm not sure they really felt comfortable doing.\" The order directs the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative and the Department of Commerce to crack down on \"unreasonable and discriminatory policies\" in foreign countries that \"suppress\" drug prices abroad, the officials said. \"We are going to be working to make sure that countries aren't being unfair in their negotiations with pharmaceutical companies, right?\" one official said. Drugmakers are \"constantly complaining\" about being put \"in an untenable situation when in these negotiations\" because those companies typically have to broker drug discounts with entire countries, the official added. Unlike the U.S., several foreign countries offer universal health coverage where the government is the sole payer, giving it significant leverage to negotiate or set drug prices. White House officials said they expect drugmakers to provide discounts across the board to \"reciprocate\" the actions the Trump administration is taking to address prices abroad. Trump's order also directs the secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services to establish a pathway for U.S. patients to buy their drugs directly from manufacturers at most favored nation prices, bypassing middlemen. \"We're going to cut out the middlemen and facilitate the direct sale of drugs at the most favorite nation price, directly to the American citizen,\" Trump said. Within 30 days, the secretary will also have to set clear targets for price reductions across all markets in the U.S., according to the officials. That will open up a round of negotiations between HHS and the pharmaceutical industry, officials said, not providing exact details on the nature of those talks. If \"adequate progress\" is not made toward those price targets, HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. will impose the most favored nation pricing on drugs through rulemaking. The order also directs the Food and Drug Administration to consider expanding imports from other developed nations beyond Canada. Trump   in April directing the FDA to improve   by which states can apply to import lower-cost drugs from Canada, among other actions intended to lower drug prices. Monday's order also directs the Department of Justice and Federal Trade Commission to aggressively enforce \"anti-competitive actions\" that keep prices high in the U.S. The Department of Commerce will also consider export restrictions that \"fuel and enable that low pricing abroad.\"  Drugmakers have argued that the most favored nation policy would hurt their profits and ultimately, their ability to research and develop new medicines. White House officials contended that pharmaceutical companies will continue to make money after the price cuts if they realize that the U.S. \"alone is not going to pay for innovation\" and if they increase prices abroad to get additional revenue there. Drugmakers \"should pursue deals where they get financially rewarded commensurate the value that they are providing to other nations, health systems,\" one official said. \"Other countries should pay research and development, too. It's for their benefit,\" Trump added on Monday. The industry also lobbied against similar Trump plans during his first term. He tried to   in the final months of that term, but a federal judge  the effort   from the pharmaceutical industry. The Biden administration then rescinded that policy. White House officials   congressional Republicans to include a most favored nation provision in the major reconciliation bill they plan to pass in the coming months, but the policy would have specifically targeted Medicaid drug costs, Politico reported earlier this month. Several GOP members opposed that measure. The industry's largest trade group, PhRMA,  that Trump's Medicaid proposal could cost drugmakers as much as $1 trillion over a decade.  Some health policy experts have said a most favored nation drug policy may not be effective at lowering medication costs. For example,   the policy \"can't undo the basic economics of the global drug marketplace,\" where 70% of pharmaceutical profits worldwide come from the U.S. \"Facing a choice between deep cuts in their U.S. pricing or the loss of weakly profitable overseas markets, we can expect many firms to pull out from overseas markets at their earliest opportunity,\" experts said in a report in April.  That will leave Americans paying the same amount for medications, drugmakers with lower profits and future generations of patients with less innovation, they said. \"In sum, everyone loses,\" the experts said. Even if the drug industry pushes back on Trump's executive order in court, his administration still has another tool to push down drug prices: Medicare drug price negotiations. It's a key provision of the Inflation Reduction Act that gives Medicare the power to negotiate certain prescription drug prices with manufacturers for the first time in history. Trump last month proposed a change to that policy that drugmakers have long sought. Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle could be receptive to the idea, which proposes changing rules that differentiate between small-molecule drugs and biologic medicines. Trump last week said he plans to announce tariffs on medicines imported into the U.S. within the next two weeks. Those planned levies aim to boost domestic drug manufacturing.  Drugmakers, including   and  , are pushing back on those potential duties. Some companies have questioned whether the tariffs are necessary, given that several of them have already   since Trump took office.  Still, Trump last week doubled down on efforts to reshore drug manufacturing.

That's broader than a similar policy proposal from Trump's first term, which was ultimately blocked in court after the pharmaceutical industry challenged it.  Trump is taking aim at a longstanding issue that past administrations have also tried to confront: U.S. prescription drug prices are   in other developed nations – and up to 10 times more than in certain countries, according to the Rand Corporation, a public policy think tank. The president claimed the order will help lower drug prices between 59% and 80%, or \"I guess even 90%.\" But health policy experts said it is still unclear how much the policy could reduce prices for patients, how much it will affect drugmakers' profits, which medicines will be targeted — and whether Trump can even put the plan into effect in the first place. Investors seemed to shrug Monday about how much the plan would hit major drugmakers. Shares of   rose 7%,   climbed 5%,  ,   and   climbed more than 3% and   rose more than 2%. JPMorgan analysts on Monday called the policy \"challenging to practically implement\" because it would likely require congressional approval and could run into legal challenges from drugmakers. Notably, several Republican lawmakers opposed including a most favored nation provision in the major economic policy bill they plan to pass in the coming months. \"The road ahead could be muddy,\" the analysts wrote in a note.  While experts backed the idea of lowering prices, they raised doubts about whether other nations and drugmakers will do what Trump hopes to accomplish with the order. \"We're unlikely to get the drug companies to voluntarily decrease their prices, and we're not going to get the other countries to voluntarily increase their prices, right?\" said Gerard Anderson, professor of health policy and management at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.  Trump's order takes aim in part at other countries, many of which have single-payer health systems with more leverage to negotiate down drug prices with manufacturers. In contrast, the U.S. has a patchwork of public and private insurance and partly relies on middlemen to set prices.  The president's policy directs the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative and the Department of Commerce to fight what the administration called \"unreasonable and discriminatory policies\" in foreign countries that \"unfairly undercut market prices and drive price hikes in the United States.\" In a statement on Monday, the pharmaceutical industry's biggest lobbying group, PhRMA, lauded Trump for taking aim at other nations for what they deemed \"not paying their fair share.\"  But other countries' governments are simply negotiating within the limits of their national health budgets, not using \"unfair\" methods like Trump claims, said Lawrence Gostin, a professor of public health law at Georgetown University. He added that they are securing fair prices for their own countries, which \"has nothing to do with undercutting the U.S.\" It's unclear what actions the U.S. could take to force other nations to take action, but Anderson said there is currently no incentive for them to hike their prices.  \"They have a system that works for them and they get lower prices. Countries like France and Switzerland are all not going to sit there and say, 'Hey, now I want to pay more,'\" he said.  The pharmaceutical industry would likely want to to see price hikes in countries within the European Union before it voluntarily lowers any drug prices in the U.S., JPMorgan analysts said. That makes other pieces of the executive order appear unlikely to come to pass. Trump's order directs the Health and Human Services secretary to establish a way for U.S. patients to buy their drugs directly from manufacturers at \"most favored nation\" prices, cutting out middlemen. The order mentions \"direct-to-consumer purchasing programs,\" without further details. His plan also calls for HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to give drugmakers price reduction targets within the next 30 days, which will open up negotiations with the companies. If \"adequate progress\" is not made toward those goals within six months of the order being signed, HHS will impose most favored nation pricing on drugs through rulemaking or \"other aggressive measures,\" according to the order. But Anderson said it would likely take far longer for the government and drugmakers to agree on a price. Under a provision of the Inflation Reduction Act, Medicare and drug manufacturers typically take six months to a year to negotiate prices.  He added, \"Why would any drug company ever lower their prices voluntarily?\" Anderson noted that the order did not provide details on the exact actions the administration could take against drugmakers who don't agree, so the incentives are unclear.  The Department of Justice and Federal Trade Commission will also take action against \"anti-competitive actions\" that keep prices high in the U.S., White House officials said.  \"There will be an expectation that those prices should come down. And then if they don't, we will be looking at our various policy levers that can be used to force those prices down,\" one official said. 'We absolutely are going to get a better deal.'\" The order also directs the Food and Drug Administration to consider expanding imports from other developed nations beyond Canada. Trump signed a separate executive order in April directing the FDA to improve the process by which states can apply to import lower-cost drugs from Canada, among other actions intended to lower drug prices. The Trump administration claims that some drug prices will fall by up to 90% \"almost immediately.\" White House officials also said the administration will have a particular focus on drugs that have the \"largest disparities and largest expenditures,\" which could include popular weight loss and diabetes treatments called GLP-1 drugs. But experts cast doubts on whether the administration can cut prices significantly, as it's still unclear which drugs and nations will be targeted, and whether other countries and drugmakers will comply.  \"We don't know the list of nations included,\" said Tricia Neuman, executive director for the program on Medicare policy at KFF, a health policy research group. \"Their pricing would make a big difference in what our prices would be, which could then affect access in the U.S.\" In Anderson's view, the order as written won't be effective at lowering drug prices.  \"It's a great idea to pay international prices, but it's how you get to implement it. There are no details and ability to effectuate it,\" he said.  Gostin also added that Americans will likely not see lower prices \"in the foreseeable future.\"  Still, AARP, which advocates for older Americans, thanked Trump for issuing the order in a statement on Monday. \"It's safe to say that we are excited about any attempts to help bring down prescription drug prices,\" said Leigh Purvis, the prescription drug policy principal in AARP's Public Policy Institute. \"This approach is unusually understandable to the public because I think there's a general understanding that America does pay the highest prescription drug prices in the world.\" She added that the \"devil is in the details, and that's what we're looking forward to seeing more of.\" The pharmaceutical industry has argued that a \"most favored nation\" policy will hurt its profits and ability to research and develop new drugs. Last week, PhRMA even  that Trump's proposal – if applied to the Medicaid program specifically – could cost drugmakers as much as $1 trillion over a decade.  But Monday's executive order seems to be \"more of a headline risk\" than the sweeping shift for the pharmaceutical industry many had feared, BMO Capital Markets analyst Evan Seigerman said in a note on Monday.  He pointed to the uncertain path forward for the plan, saying it \"could be more rhetoric than actual implementable policy.\" Seigerman added that Trump appeared to be somewhat sympathetic to U.S. manufacturers, with the president arguing that European nations are not supporting drug research and development due to their lower prices.  Anderson said the pharmaceutical industry may be breathing a \"sigh of relief today,\" pending further details on what the administration's retaliatory actions could look like.  Trump's order suggests that it is ultimately voluntary for drugmakers to lower prices and, subsequently, profits, so \"he did not propose something that is mandatory and really has teeth here.\" Still, while PhRMA agreed with Trump's decision to target other countries, the group emphasized that \"importing foreign prices from socialist countries would be a bad deal for American patients and workers. \"It would mean less treatments and cures and would jeopardize the hundreds of billions our member companies are planning to invest in America – threatening jobs, hurting our economy and making us more reliant on China for innovative medicines,\" the group said in a statement. Some analysts and experts said Trump could alternatively implement his most favored nation policy through an existing tool to push down drug prices:  . It's a key provision of the Biden administration's Inflation Reduction Act that gives Medicare the power to negotiate certain prescription drug prices with manufacturers. The federal program is currently in its   of talks with drugmakers. The Trump administration could use the \"most favored nation\" price for a given drug as the initial offer to manufacturers at the beginning of negotiations, Anderson said. \"You'd be starting the negotiation at an even lower price than they have in the past,\" he said, adding that it would not require any help from Congress. JPMorgan analysts added that \"we see a clearer pathway for the administration to implement [the most favored nation policy] at a smaller scale through Medicare IRA price negotiations, where the impact would be limited to a small number of drugs\" and make the hit to drugmaker profits more gradual.", "summary": null, "related_articles": [], "metadata": {"author": null, "publish_date": "2025-05-12T19:54:25+0000", "read_time": null, "keywords": "Breaking News: Business,Health care industry,Pharmaceuticals,Biotech and Pharmaceuticals,Biotechnology,Business,United States,Donald Trump,Social issues,Donald J.

The process was established under the Biden administration's signature Inflation Reduction Act as a way to rein in high health care costs for older Americans.  CMS plans to announce a list of 15 drugs eligible for the third round of price talks by February 2026, which will then kick off months of back and forth between the government and manufacturers if they agree to participate. The new negotiated prices for those products will go into effect in 2028. But here are the biggest changes this time around:  \"This draft guidance is critical to creating a transparent, competitive, and fair prescription drug market that puts American patients first,\" Medicare Director Chris Klomp said in a  . But Wall Street analysts are focused on another part of the guidance that could cause issues for  ,   and some other pharmaceutical companies.  The guidance document suggests that the Trump administration could end a workaround that those companies are using to drag out revenue from top-earning cancer drugs, such as Merck's Keytruda and Bristol Myers Squibb's Opdivo. The plan had been to shift patients to newer injectable – or subcutaneous – versions of their cancer drugs and keep charging Medicare higher prices for them, even after their original intravenous versions are subject to new negotiated prices under the program. Drugmakers have been banking on those subcutaneous versions as a way to dampen the revenue they would lose from Medicare drug price negotiations, along with upcoming patent expirations for the original forms of their drugs. For example, key patents for Keytruda start expiring in 2028.  Under the current rules, complex drugs known as biologics are eligible for the negotiation process after 13 years, but the clock restarts for a new version of the drug – like a subcutaneous form – that adds an additional active ingredient. Subcutaneous versions of drugs like Opdivo are combination products that include an additional ingredient, allowing them to be injected quickly instead of being slowly infused like the original intravenous form. But on Monday, CMS said it is \"soliciting comments\" on how it \"might consider\" grouping these combination drugs with their original versions — if the added ingredient doesn't affect how the drug treats the underlying disease. In other words, the agency is considering whether to count two versions of a drug as a single product in certain cases.  That appears to be \"somewhat targeted\" at products such as subcutaneous Keytruda and Opdivo, JPMorgan analysts said in a note on Monday. They said the guidance leads to \"at least the potential for inclusion\" of those drugs in future negotiations.  Still, no changes are final yet, so it may be too soon to predict the impact on drugmakers like Merck and Bristol Myers Squibb.  Feel free to send any tips, suggestions, story ideas and data to Annika at  .

OpenAI on Monday launched a new evaluation tool called HealthBench, a benchmark that will help test how artificial intelligence models perform in realistic health-care scenarios.  \"If developed and deployed effectively, large language models have the potential to expand access to health information, support clinicians in delivering high-quality care, and help people advocate for their health and that of their communities,\" OpenAI said in a  . \"To get there, we need to ensure models are useful and safe.\" The company said HealthBench was developed alongside 262 doctors from 60 countries. It's based on 5,000 conversations that simulate interactions between individual users or clinicians and AI models. The discussions are split into seven different themes, including global health, emergency situations and handling uncertainty.  When a model responds to a prompt, each response is graded against a set of \"physician-written rubric criteria specific to that conversation,\" OpenAI said. HealthBench contains 48,562 unique rubric criteria. OpenAI included one example where a user said they found their 70-year-old neighbor unresponsive on the floor. The AI model in that instance told the user to take action right away, and included eight steps they could follow. HealthBench gave this answer a 77% based on its rubric criteria.  OpenAI said HealthBench responses were evaluated against responses written by doctors to understand how the model compared to their clinical judgement. The company found that HealthBench \"closely aligns\" with physicians' grading.  OpenAI said it used HealthBench to evaluate several existing models, including its own o3, GPT-4.1, o1, GPT-4o and GPT-3.5 Turbo models, xAI's Grok 3, Google's Gemini 2.5 Pro, Anthropic's Claude 3.7 Sonnet and Meta's Llama 4 Maverick.  The company found that o3 outperformed other models, and it said its models have improved by 28% on HealthBench.  OpenAI said the full evaluation suite and underlying data for HealthBench is available in its GitHub repository.  \"We hope this supports shared progress toward using AI systems to improve human health,\" the company said.

Anti-natalism refers to the belief that no one should have children. Investigators are focusing on social media posts made by the suspect, including a 30-minute audio recording, which they say support anti-natalist views. While the posts and the recording are still being verified, officials believe they reflect the ideology behind the bombing. The same person may also be linked to an online forum post from earlier this month in which the individual contemplated suicide using an explosive device, the sources said. They are also investigating a YouTube account, under the same moniker, that features videos of experiments with homemade explosives. The suspect, who has not been identified, was reportedly dealing with depression and had personal relationship issues. Authorities believe the suspect is a 25-year-old man from Twentynine Palms, three law enforcement sources familiar with the investigation told NBC News. On Saturday, multiple law enforcement tactical officers were seen outside a Twentynine Palms residence, about an hour away from the targeted fertility clinic. The activity there was connected to the Palm Springs investigation, the sources confirmed to NBC News. The FBI and Palm Springs Police Department have held off on identifying the suspect, citing the condition his body after the blast. The seriousness of the injuries of those hurt by the blast was not disclosed. The FBI deemed the explosion an act of terrorism on Saturday. The blast took place at 1199 North Indian Canyon Dr. at around 11 a.m.,  . The street is home to a number of medical facilities, including the Desert Regional Medical Center. The apparent target of the attack, a fertility clinic called American Reproductive Centers (ARC), confirmed in a   that a vehicle exploded in the parking lot near its Palm Springs facility. The explosion caused damage to multiple buildings and businesses within 250-yard blast radius, officials said. Witnesses said the blast was heard or felt from miles away.   The investigation is intensifying rapidly on multiple fronts, law enforcement officials told NBC News.  On Sunday, officials continue forensic examinations of physical evidence at and around the blast zone, while canvasing the area for video footage to help establish a timeline of events leading up to the explosion. Authorities are seeking interviews with family, friends and associates, while reviewing social media accounts and online posts that may be linked to the case. The incident is likely one of the largest bombing investigations in Southern California that the FBI has handled, Akil Davis, assistant director of the bureau's Los Angeles field office, said.  Palm Springs Police Chief Andy Mills believes the explosion was an isolated incident.  \"I am confident that the community is not at risk any longer,\" Mills said on Saturday.", "summary": null, "related_articles": [], "metadata": {"author": null, "publish_date": "2025-05-18T15:48:10+0000", "read_time": null, "keywords": "Health care industry,business news"}, "category": "Health and Science"}

The Danish drugmaker on Friday abruptly announced that longtime CEO Lars Fruergaard Jørgensen is  , as its obesity injection Wegovy loses ground to  's rival treatment, Zepbound. While Eli Lilly entered the market later, it is emerging as the front-runner in a space that some analysts believe could be worth more than $150 billion by the early 2030s.  Novo Nordisk's new top executive will need to help the company close the gap with Eli Lilly, fend off emerging rivals and navigate other challenges. The next CEO will have to spearhead the company's plans to launch a new slate of weight loss drugs before key patents for Wegovy expire, and manage the impact of   and President  's  .  It's unclear who will take Jørgensen's place, but the company said it is considering both internal and external candidates.  \"While Novo [Nordisk] took a commanding early lead in the obesity duopoly, they have ceded ground at a critical moment when more competitors are quickly approaching,\" BMO Capital Markets analyst Evan Seigerman said in a note Friday, referring to other drugmakers racing to market their own obesity treatments.  Novo Nordisk once held the title of Europe's most valuable company – worth $615 billion at its peak – driven by skyrocketing demand for Wegovy and its diabetes counterpart, Ozempic. But investor enthusiasm has faded after Eli Lilly gained a bigger share of the market and clinical trial data on Novo Nordisk's next wave of obesity drugs underwhelmed investors. Shares of Novo Nordisk have plunged more than 50% over the past year, wiping out more than $300 billion in market value. Novo Nordisk's stock is still up more than 250% since Jørgensen took over as CEO in January 2017. But shares of Eli Lilly have gained about 800% since that same month, when CEO Dave Ricks took over the company.  Mounting pressure also came from the powerful Novo Nordisk Foundation, the controlling shareholder of the Danish drugmaker. The foundation recently urged Novo Nordisk's leadership to consider an \"accelerated CEO succession\" and pushed for greater board representation, according to a   on Friday. Novo Nordisk on Friday said it jointly concluded with Jørgensen that it was time to find a new CEO following the foundation's request, recent market challenges and the steep decline in the company's share price. Jørgensen said he did not see his ouster coming and was only informed of it recently, according to several  on Friday.  Days before the announcement, Novo Nordisk slashed its sales and profit forecast for the first time since the launch of Wegovy four years ago.  Seigerman said it's still unclear whether a new top executive will be able to address the company's challenges. \"Although it might satisfy some for investors to drive a CEO transition, without meaningful change in near-term strategy, we continue to see a more difficult path forward,\" he said.  Novo Nordisk has been ceding market share to Eli Lilly, even though Zepbound's dollar sales still trail Wegovy's.  Zepbound and Eli Lilly's diabetes drug Mounjaro now make up over half of U.S. prescriptions for so-called GLP-1s, which mimic hormones to tamp down appetite and regulate blood sugar, according to a separate note from Seigerman earlier this month.  That outpaces the combined 46% share of Novo Nordisk's Wegovy and Ozempic.  New U.S. prescriptions of Zepbound surpassed those for Wegovy for the first time in early March 2024, just months after the launch of Eli Lilly's drug,  reported at the time. By August, some analysts were estimating that Zepbound had captured 40% of the U.S. weight loss drug market, hot on Wegovy's heels. That \"market-share traction clearly demonstrates that physicians and patients prefer Zepbound\" over Wegovy, Bernstein analyst Courtney Breen wrote in a note in early May. Real-world data and   have shown that Zepbound leads to more weight loss than Wegovy.  Novo Nordisk has also struggled to convince Wall Street that its pipeline of next-generation weight loss drugs can help it maintain its position in the market, especially after Wegovy loses exclusivity and drugmakers can sell cheaper generic alternatives.  For example, Novo Nordisk repeatedly told investors its CagriSema shot, expected to be launched in 2026, would help people lose 25% or more of their body weight. But the   in December 2024, sending shares of the company plunging.  The company in April said it has filed for U.S. approval of an oral version of semaglutide, the active ingredient in Wegovy and Ozempic. It comes as drugmakers rush to develop more convenient weight loss pills, which could account for $50 billion of the market in the coming years, according to some analyst  .  But Seigerman, in a separate note in April, said Novo Nordisk has no clear strategy for its oral obesity drug portfolio. He said that is \"likely to challenge growth in the end of the decade,\" especially as Eli Lilly's own obesity pill impresses investors and inches closer to entering the market.  Unlike oral semaglutide, Eli Lilly's pill is a small-molecule drug and not a peptide medication. That means Eli Lilly's drug is absorbed more easily in the body and doesn't require dietary restrictions like oral semaglutide does, which may be a notable advantage for the company.  Seigerman acknowledged that Novo Nordisk's experimental small-molecule pill, amycretin, could be competitive long term. But he said that won't happen soon, as the drug is not expected to launch for several years.  Outside of pipeline issues, Novo Nordisk and the rest of the pharmaceutical industry are grappling with the Trump administration's ambitions to lower drug prices and bring manufacturing to the U.S. Trump has said he plans to impose tariffs on pharmaceuticals imported into the U.S. and signed an executive order that aims to  .  Novo Nordisk made it clear that its strategy remains unchanged despite Jørgensen's abrupt exit.  \"We have a strong product portfolio with lots of potential,\" Novo Nordisk board Chairman Helge Lund said on a call with analysts Friday. \"We have an experienced executive team to continue to evolve and drive the company forward with a long-term perspective.\" But Seigerman said the decision to swap CEOs seems to \"draw attention to pivots in this strategy that may be necessary.\"  Investors have already been seeing potential signs of that shift, according to Seigerman. Novo Nordisk has long prioritized peptide-based therapeutics. But the company's recent deal-making indicates that it is leaning \"heavier on oral small molecule solutions for the obesity market,\" Seigerman said.  The company last week announced  with the U.S. biotech company Septerna for experimental small-molecule pills for obesity and other cardiometabolic diseases.  But those pills are in early development and those products are years from entering the market, meaning the agreement is still risky.  The same can be said of several of Novo Nordisk's other recent tie-ups. For example, Novo Nordisk in March said it had   up to $2 billion for the rights to an early experimental drug from the Chinese pharmaceutical company United Laboratories International.  The newly acquired drug is a clear potential competitor to Eli Lilly's so-called Triple G obesity drug retatrutide because they both use a three-pronged approach to promoting weight loss and regulating blood sugar. But retatrutide is in late-stage clinical trials, which means it could enter the market years before Novo Nordisk's drug does. ", "summary": null, "related_articles": [], "metadata": {"author": null, "publish_date": "2025-05-19T17:12:34+0000", "read_time": null, "keywords": "Breaking News: Business,Health care industry,Pharmaceuticals,Biotech and Pharmaceuticals,Biotechnology,Business,Novo Nordisk A/S,Novo Nordisk A/S,LILLY DRN,Donald J.

The pharmaceutical giant now expects its adjusted fiscal 2025 earnings to come in between $20.78 and $22.28 per share, down from previous guidance of $22.50 to $24 per share. Eli Lilly said the revision reflects a $1.57 billion deal charge recorded in the first quarter, which is primarily related to its acquisition of a certain oral cancer drug from Scorpion Therapeutics. The company maintained its fiscal 2025 sales guidance of $58 billion to $61 billion. Eli Lilly said the guidance reflects President  's existing tariffs as of May 1, but does not include his planned levies on pharmaceuticals imported into the U.S. In an interview with CNBC, Eli Lilly CEO Dave Ricks said the company and other drugmakers are already announcing  , which is one of the Trump administration's stated goals of the tariffs. \"I think that actually the threat of tariffs is already bringing back critical supply chains into important industries, chips and pharma,\" Ricks said. \"So do we need to enact [tariffs?] I'm not so sure.\" He added that Eli Lilly wants to see permanently lower tax rates in the U.S., particularly 15% for domestic production. Ricks said lower taxes drove many drugmakers to manufacture in \"low-tax islands like Ireland Singapore and in Switzerland, and that can come back if there's an economic incentive.\" Eli Lilly's blockbuster diabetes treatment Mounjaro topped expectations for the first quarter, raking in $3.84 billion in revenue. That's up a whopping 113% from the same period a year ago. The company's weight loss drug Zepbound also beat estimates, booking $2.31 billion in sales for the quarter. That more than quadrupled the $517.4 million that the treatment brought in a year ago, when it had just entered the U.S. market. Analysts expected Mounjaro and Zepbound to generate $3.81 billion and $2.28 billion in sales, respectively, according to estimates from StreetAccount. Shares of Eli Lilly closed more than 11% on Thursday. That came after   on Thursday said its pharmacy benefit manager would make   Wegovy the preferred weight loss medication on its main formularies instead of Zepbound. Here's what Eli Lilly reported for the first quarter compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:  The company posted first-quarter revenue of $12.73 billion, up 45% from the same period a year ago.  Sales in the U.S. jumped 49% to $8.49 billion. Eli Lilly said that was driven by a 57% increase in volume – or the number of prescriptions or units sold – for Zepbound and Mounjaro. That was partially offset by lower realized prices of the drugs, the company said. The pharmaceutical giant booked net income of $2.76 billion, or $3.06 per share, for the first quarter. That compares with net income of $2.24 billion, or $2.48 share, a year earlier.  Excluding one-time items associated with the value of intangible assets and other adjustments, Eli Lilly posted earnings of $3.34 per share for the first quarter. Demand in the U.S. has still far outpaced supply of Zepbound and Mounjaro over the last year. Both so-called incretin treatments mimic certain gut hormones to tamp down a person's appetite and regulate their blood sugar. The popularity of those injectable drugs has forced both Eli Lilly and its rival   to invest billions to ramp up manufacturing capacity for their treatments. The efforts appear to be paying off: The Food and Drug Administration in December   to declare the U.S. shortage of tirzepatide — the active ingredient in Zepbound and Mounjaro — over.

He spoke after Eli Lilly  , which did not include estimated effects of the potential pharmaceutical tariffs. He said national security concerns around those medications are \"valid.\" But he added: \"Do I think tariffs are the answer to that?

References to the insect were abundant at the company's old headquarters in London, where a picture of a cockroach was prominently displayed on the wall. For much of Hinge's 10-year history, the cockroach was the unofficial mascot. Staffers named it Flossy after the viral dance move \"the floss.\" Perez relishes the symbolism. In his determination to build a company that will push through adversity, he's encouraged employees to think of themselves like cockroaches, due to the creature's grimy resilience and noted ability to survive harsh conditions. \"It was the identity of every individual in the company,\" said Joshua Sturm, a vice president at Hinge from 2019 to 2024 and now chief revenue officer at cancer prevention startup Color Health. \"We are all in this together, and no matter what happens, we are going to survive together.\" Perez and his 1,400-person workforce now face the ultimate test of their mettle. Hinge, which moved from London to San Francisco in 2017, is trying to go public at a time of such extreme economic uncertainty and market volatility that several companies, including online lender   and ticket marketplace  , have delayed their long-awaited IPOs. Hinge filed its prospectus  , announcing plans to trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol \"HNGE.\" Three weeks later,   announced a sweeping tariff policy that plunged U.S. markets into turmoil after tariff concerns had already pushed the Nasdaq to its worst quarter since 2022. But Hinge, led by its 39-year-old co-founder and CEO, appears determined to power through the chaos. Hinge declined to comment or make Perez available for an interview.  Going public was already going to be a risky endeavor for Hinge. The IPO market has been   since late 2021, when soaring inflation and rising interest rates pushed investors out of risky assets. Within digital health, it's been almost completely dead. Health-tech companies have struggled to adapt to a more muted growth environment following the Covid pandemic, and many once promising business models haven't panned out as planned. The starkest example is virtual health company  , which has a market cap of just over $1 billion less than five years after buying digital health provider Livongo in a deal that valued the   at $37 billion. Teladoc's BetterHelp mental health unit has been a particularly troublesome business as paying users dropped off in the years following the pandemic. Over time, Hinge's Cockroach Award transitioned from a monthly prize to a quarterly distinction. The company phased it out entirely about a year ago in preparation for its next public-facing chapter, but the survive-at-all-costs mentality persists, according to current employees. Now, staffers are recognized with the \"Movers Awards,\" a nod to the company's focus on movement. \"We have many decades of work ahead,\" Perez wrote in a letter to investors in March. \"We hope you join us on this journey.\" CNBC spoke to 13 current and former Hinge employees, investors, and people close to Perez for this story, some of whom asked not to be named in order to provide candid commentary. Hinge uses software to help patients treat acute musculoskeletal injuries, chronic pain and carry out post-surgery rehabilitation remotely. Large employers like   and   cover the costs so their employees can access Hinge's app-based virtual physical therapy, as well as its wearable electrical nerve stimulation device called Enso.  The company   its technology can help users manage pain, cut down health-care costs and reduce the need for surgery and opioids. Revenue increased 33% to $390.4 million last year, while its net loss narrowed to $11.9 million from $108.1 million a year earlier, according to the prospectus. Hinge's roster of clients expanded by 36% last year to 2,256, and the number of individual members jumped 44% to over 532,300, the filing said. In an   on Monday, Hinge   revenue in its first quarter climbed 50% to $123.8 million, up from $82.7 million during the same period last year, and that net income for the period was $17.1 million compared to a loss of $26.5 million a year ago.  Hinge has raised more than $1 billion from investors including Tiger Global Management and Coatue Management, and it boasted a   as of October 2021, the last time the company raised outside funding. The biggest institutional shareholders are venture firms Insight Partners and Atomico, which own 19% and 15% of the stock, respectively, according to the filing. Perez and Gabriel Mecklenburg, Hinge's executive chairman, started the company in 2014. The pair met while they were both pursuing PhDs in the U.K. — Perez at the University of Oxford and Mecklenburg at Imperial College London. They were distracted students, according to Perez's twin brother, David.  By the time they launched Hinge, Perez and Mecklenburg had already co-founded two other ventures together. One was the Oxbridge Biotech Roundtable, an organization that connected academics and industry experts. The other was Marblar, which worked to commercialize academic intellectual property. Perez took a leave of absence from Oxford while working on Marblar and never returned. His brother wasn't a fan of the decision initially. \"I gave him terrible advice,\" said David Perez, a graduate of Yale Law School and partner at Perkins Coie in Seattle. \"I was like, 'I think you're an idiot, I think you should focus on your PhD. Only an idiot would not finish a PhD at Oxford.'\"  The twins have two older siblings. Their mother immigrated from Cuba in 1968, followed 12 years later by their father. Their parents met in Miami, got married after just three dates, and are still together after more than 40 years.  The family moved from Miami to Salt Lake City, Utah, in 1990. Perez's mother was a substitute teacher and his father worked at restaurants as a dishwasher and busboy. David Perez said their father \"worked around the clock\" and used to call out orders in his sleep.  \"It wasn't a lot of money, I think combined they made about $19,000 a year,\" David Perez said. \"But they stitched it together and raised four kids.\"  The twin boys were competitive, particularly when it came to academics and playing basketball in the driveway. David said his brother got \"great grades\" and always had an inclination toward science and medicine, graduating from high school at age 16 and then starting college at Westminster University, a small liberal arts school in Utah. \"I swear,\" David Perez said, \"there were times where the only punishment that my mom could issue that would have the sting was restricting our ability to do homework.\" Perez was a student in the Honors College at Westminster, and he graduated with a degree in biology. Richard Badenhausen, dean of the Honors College, described Perez as an independent thinker and an ambitious student, especially for his age.  \"He didn't care too much what people thought about him, which is a strength in my book,\" Badenhausen said in an interview.  When Perez was 13, he was hit by a car. He broke an arm and a leg, and had to be airlifted to a nearby hospital. After three surgeries and 12 months of rehab, he had a newfound interest in orthopedics and physical therapy.  Mecklenburg had a serious injury of his own, tearing his anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) during a judo match, which also required a year of rehab, according to Hinge's website. One day in October 2014  the pair put their heads together and outlined the tools they wished were available while undergoing physical therapy. Musculoskeletal conditions affect as many as 1.7 billion people worldwide, according to Hinge's prospectus, so there was no shortage of opportunities. They had the early concept of Hinge within hours and a prototype ready by December of that year. In Hinge's early days, Perez and Mecklenburg would meet every Saturday morning to talk shop. Now, as they've aged and started families, they meet on Wednesday nights, according to colleagues. Perez welcomed his first child with his wife late last year.  \"Seeing the growth over the last six, seven, eight years has just been unbelievable,\" said Jon Reynolds, a tech founder who contributed to Hinge's seed funding round. \"That comes down to the quality of Dan and Gabriel as leaders. They complement each other really well, and they've obviously got that mutual respect.\" Perez is a hands-on CEO who expects a lot from his staff.  He's direct, detail-oriented, opinionated, competitive and can be intense, according to current and former employees. But he's committed to the mission and the wellbeing of his employees, they said. \"He's one of those rare founder CEOs who I think can go all the way,\" said Paul Kruszewski, a former Hinge employee who joined the company after it acquired his Canadian computer vision startup, Wrnch, in 2021.  Employees say Perez is a voracious reader, often finishing two to four books a month. That includes books about business and leadership, an important source of information given that Hinge was his first real job. He's a fan of \"The Innovator's Prescription,\" by   and others, \"Crossing the Chasm,\" by Geoffrey Moore and \"The Long Fix,\" by Dr. Vivian Lee. He also likes his staffers to read. Executives will often prepare to discuss chapters from a book in their meetings.  \"I'd come home and there'd be a package from Dan, and it's a book,\" said Sturm, who led partnerships and new market development at Hinge. \"That was just the norm.\" Sturm, who has worked in the health-care and benefits space for around 30 years, said Hinge was very deliberate with hiring, so there wasn't a lot of turnover among senior executives. He said Hinge's recruitment process was the hardest he's ever experienced.  Another \"Dan-ism,\" as Sturm called it, is Hinge's philosophy around writing. Perez has employees write memos, typically up to six pages long, instead of preparing slide decks or other materials ahead of meetings. Perez was inspired by a similar practice at  , according to current and former employees, and sees it as a way to force employees to think through what they want to say instead of hiding behind bullet points. Hinge's memo culture can be an adjustment, particularly for new employees. Sturm said he thought the practice was \"insane\" at first, but ultimately came to appreciate it and said it improved his pitches. \"When you sort of sit back, you go, 'You know actually, he wasn't wrong,'\" Sturm said.  Hinge has come a long way since venture firm Atomico led the $8 million Series A investment in 2017. The London-based firm said in a   at the time that it was \"extremely impressed by Daniel and Gabriel, and their determination to tackle a big problem in society.\" Carolina Brochado led the round, though she left Atomico a year later and now works at investment firm EQT Group. She said that getting Hinge to the brink of an IPO was a \"one in a million chance,\" but noted that the company has managed to build a sizable business in digital health despite having so many odds stacked against it. \"Lots of learnings along the way, of course, like a big tech correction in the middle,\" Brochado said in an interview. \"But it really is one of those rare examples of just an enormous market that was under penetrated.\" For David Perez, whose firm now serves as Hinge's outside counsel, watching the startup grow has been \"fascinating,\" he said. \"I'm a partner at a major law firm,\" he said, \"and I am only the second most successful twin. But I think I'm okay with that.\"  ", "summary": null, "related_articles": [], "metadata": {"author": null, "publish_date": "2025-05-05T12:00:01+0000", "read_time": null, "keywords": "IPO,Teladoc Health Inc,Amazon.com Inc,Breaking News: Technology,Technology,Internet,Health care industry,Venture capital,Target Corp,Morgan Stanley,Donald J.

Shares of the company closed up 23% on April 29, for instance, after   said it would offer its weight loss drug Wegovy through telehealth providers like Hims & Hers.

Caremark negotiated an undisclosed lower net price for Wegovy over Zepbound on its standard formularies, offering savings on Novo Nordisk's drug to clients that opt into those plans.  But employers and unions will ultimately determine how much of those savings on Wegovy get shared with members, CVS said.  Wegovy's list price before insurance is $1,349 for a month's supply, while Zepbound's is $1,086. That decision by one of the nation's largest PBMs triggered fears of a price war in the weight loss drug market and concerns that Zepbound's sales momentum could stall. Shares of Eli Lilly plunged 11% on Thursday.  But several Wall Street analysts said the selloff was overblown. \"In our view, the Novo/CVS deal does not represent the beginning of an obesity pricing war between Lilly & Novo,\" BMO Capital Markets analyst Evan Seigerman said in a note on Thursday. He added that in discussions with the companies, both Lilly and Novo emphasized they want to expand patient access – not undercut each other on price. That may be reassuring to investors worried that a price war could hurt profit margins. But the high list price of those weight loss drugs may remain a major barrier for many patients, particularly those whose health plans don't cover the medications.  Eli Lilly told the firm it is not interested in exclusive \"one-of-one\" deals with PBMs, while Novo Nordisk said CVS approached the drugmaker about the Wegovy agreement, according to Seigerman. On an earnings call on Thursday, Eli Lilly CEO David Ricks said the company has been trying to move away from setting high list prices and paying bigger rebates to PBMs for preferential coverage. Instead, Eli Lilly is trying to set list prices closer to what it expects the plans to pay for its drugs. \"We have been very vocal about trying to move away from that,\" Ricks said, referring to deep PBM rebates.  He added that Zepbound is still growing market share.  Seigerman agreed, saying that Eli Lilly is \"continuing to perform where it matters.\" Zepbound and the company's diabetes drug Mounjaro now make up over half of U.S. GLP-1 prescriptions, outpacing the combined 46% share of Novo Nordisk's Wegovy and its diabetes treatment Ozempic, according to Seigerman.  That \"market-share traction clearly demonstrates that physicians and patients prefer Zepbound\" over Wegovy, Bernstein analyst Courtney Breen wrote in a separate note on Thursday.  It's unclear how much the CVS formulary change will appeal to employers, especially given that Zepbound is known to be more effective at promoting weight loss than Wegovy. Some patients on the standard formularies may also try to stay on their current Zepbound prescriptions by requesting exemptions, JPMorgan analyst Chris Schott said in a Thursday note.  Eli Lilly's Ricks also said CVS' move mainly affects smaller employers, who are more likely to stick with Caremark's standard formularies. Larger companies covering more patients often use customized formularies, meaning they can still decide to include Zepbound.  Regardless, the CVS-Wegovy deal overshadowed   for Eli Lilly.  The company's first-quarter revenue and earnings topped estimates on skyrocketing demand for Zepbound and Mounjaro, both of which raked in billions of dollars in sales for the period.  We'll continue to track Eli Lilly's performance in the weight loss drug market, so stay tuned!

Health-care marketplace Zocdoc has launched an artificial intelligence phone assistant that can help patients schedule appointments using conversational language. Zocdoc, founded in 2007, helps connect patients to in-network doctors and book appointments for both in person and virtual care. The company's new AI assistant, called Zo, can handle \"unlimited\" inbound calls at any hour of the day, eliminating hold times, Zocdoc said in a release.  The company said Zo can save staffers time and improve patients' experiences, which can ultimately encourage them to seek out the care they need. The assistant also serves as a major step toward what the company called its goal of aiding scheduling \"everywhere patients are seeking care.\" \"What's most exciting about Zo is that it is powered by nearly two decades of Zocdoc's expertise in facilitating patient-provider interactions, understanding complex healthcare scheduling logic, and integrating with a broad base of [electronic health records],\" Zocdoc CEO Oliver Kharraz said in a statement.  Patients can ask Zo questions like, \"Do you take my insurance?,\" or \"Do you have any offices near the West Village?,\" according to a pre-recorded demo. Health-care organizations can implement Zo without any upfront fees, long-term costs or commitments, and they don't have to be Zocdoc Marketplace customers, the company said. Providers can try out the assistant for $2 per booked appointment, but organizations that want to roll it out on a larger scale can access discounted pricing.  Zocdoc said early adopters of Zo have been able to resolve up to 70% of all scheduling calls without staff intervention. The average call lasts around two minutes and 30 seconds.  While appointment management is Zo's first use case, Zocdoc said it's exploring other applications for the assistant, including prescription refills, messaging and outbound calls like appointment reminders or last-minute openings.  Read the full announcement  .  Feel free to send any tips, suggestions, story ideas and data to Ashley at  .", "summary": null, "related_articles": [], "metadata": {"author": null, "publish_date": "2025-05-07T14:24:03+0000", "read_time": null, "keywords": "David A.

The World Health Organization says maternal mortality is unacceptably high. More than 700 women died every day in 2023 from preventable causes related to pregnancy and childbirth, according to  It's a challenge that doctors, public health authorities and community workers have been trying to tackle. Former professional soccer player Morad Fareed thinks he can make progress improving maternal health through a love of sports. Fareed's created FC Mother, a community platform pairing expectant and new mothers with a support network. The organization aims to turn global football clubs into platforms to improve public health, a broader concept he calls \"H-sports,\" or healing sports.   \"What we did was unify the world of maternal health and use football as a vehicle to distribute it, to celebrate it, and to gamify it,\" said Fareed. The organization is kicking off what it's calling the \"World Cup of Healing\" — a competition that measures health outcomes of the participating women, grouped by their reported soccer fandom.  Mothers access services and connections via the FC Mother platform and then answer regular survey questions that assess their wellbeing. Improvements fuel team progress. FC Mother has some notable buy-in from researchers at Harvard Medical School and Harvard's School of Public Health as well as team doctors from Real Madrid, Manchester United and Arsenal FC.  The initial competition launches on Sunday and runs for 60 days through the FIFA Club World Cup Final in July. This trial run pits three football clubs in Brazil and their associated fanbases of mothers against three in the United States: Mothers of San Diego FC, Mothers of Gotham FC, and Mothers of Omaha Union.  FC Mother ranked the 48 World Cup countries by maternal health outcomes based on data from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington. The institute's Global Burden of Disease report puts the United States at 44th place, lower than any other developed country in the world among that cohort based on life-years lost due to poor maternal health outcomes. Brazil ranks 46th. Team USA in the inaugural health outcomes competition is coached by Jennie Joseph the founder of Commonsense Childbirth, who was named as a woman of the year in 2022 by Time magazine for her national work as a midwife focusing on improving maternal mortality.   Fareed's goal is to gamify community maternal health via football and prove that it can increase quality-adjusted life-years (QUALYs) for both mothers and children.  A QUALY is one year of life in perfect health, a metric that's being used by major public health organizations. It's measured with a survey that asks respondents to self-report mental and emotional health, pain levels and other health domains.   While FC Mother leaves the medical treatment of pregnancy to clinicians, Fareed points to research that illustrates perinatal mental health and robust social support can generate as many as 10 additional higher-quality-of-life years for mothers and their offspring.  \"The social determinants of health are the next frontier of maternal health and public health in general,\" said Fareed. \"It's not your doctor who you're going to call. It's the community around you. It's the day-to-day interactions you have living your life that drive stress levels, mental wellbeing, emotional wellbeing.\" Just like any other sport, FC Mother's leaderboard features the stats of the competing teams, but it also offers opportunities for the users to access immediate support from other moms. Those features are available via the FC Mother App or through Meta's WhatsApp. But FC Mother isn't a charity. Fareed intends it to be a for-profit venture. He believes corporations, professional sports, family offices and donor-advised funds will be interested in investing in a platform that delivers health improvements for a fraction of the current costs of medical intervention. FC Mother hopes the kickoff competition will provide proof-of-concept and convince 40 football clubs to participate in a he maternal health outcomes competition during the World Cup in 2026.  ", "summary": null, "related_articles": [], "metadata": {"author": null, "publish_date": "2025-05-08T10:00:01+0000", "read_time": null, "keywords": "Retail industry,Sports,Social issues,business news"}, "category": "Health and Science"}

A user's Whoop Age compares their physiological age to their actual age, and Pace of Aging assesses how fast or slow someone is aging based on their behavior.  The Healthspan feature is updated every week, and users will get tips about how they can improve their Whoop Age and Pace of Aging in their app. Whoop developed this feature in partnership with the Buck Institute for Research on Aging, the company said.  The most comprehensive membership is Whoop Life, which will give users access to additional medical-grade health features with Whoop MG.   Whoop Life members can record an electrocardiogram, or an ECG, to detect irregular heart rhythms like AFib, high heart rate or low heart rate. Once the reading is complete, they can share a PDF of the recording with their doctor.  The ECG feature has been cleared by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. It's not intended for users under 22 years old, or for users with a cardiac pacemaker or other implanted devices. It will be available in the U.S., the UAE and Qatar at launch, with additional countries coming soon.  Whoop Life members can also get daily insights about their blood pressure, including estimated systolic and diastolic ranges. Users will have to log a traditional cuff-reading to act as a baseline to unlock this feature, and it's not intended for treatment, diagnosis or medical use.   Whoop said Blood Pressure Insights has been in development for several years, and the feature is currently in beta.   I got a sneak peek at the Whoop MG, and I've been wearing it for the past few days. I can't speak to what it's like to wear the device over an extended period, but my initial experience has been largely positive.  From a hardware standpoint, the Whoop MG looks and feels sleeker than the Whoop 4.0, which I tested out in April. The actual sensor is roughly an inch wide, and the band is slightly thinner than that. I've found that both the Whoop MG and the Whoop 4.0 are a little hard to take off — you really have to tug on the latch.  The Whoop MG's setup is very straightforward, and I was up and running on the app in a matter of minutes. With all the new features, there's a lot of additional data to make sense of, so the app seemed pretty busy to me at first. I felt like I had a better handle on it after a few hours, though, and I haven't felt pressure to constantly monitor it.   Of the new features, I thought Healthspan was particularly interesting. As a relatively healthy 24-year-old, I noticed I still felt relieved to be \"younger\" than my age. I'd be curious to see how that feature would change based on my behaviors from week to week.  I also liked the Whoop MG's detailed sleep tracking and the real-time stress monitor, as stress is something I've personally been trying to be more mindful of. I've learned that my stress levels really skyrocket while I'm taking public transport, for instance, and adjust accordingly. After about a dozen tries, I wasn't able to log a successful ECG reading. I kept getting errors, even after switching wrists and the positioning of my arms. That's been disappointing, as I'm interested to see my results. The Blood Pressure Insights are neat, and assuming other users can successfully record ECG readings, it's easy to see the potential benefit. That said, I don't think I need those features in my daily life yet, so the Whoop Life membership probably wouldn't be the right pick for me.  I'm not totally sold on the Whoop MG's aesthetics. I have small hands and wrists, so I always feel like smart devices tend to look clunky on me.  I definitely felt like the Whoop 4.0 was too big for me, but the Whoop MG doesn't bother me quite as much. That's just my personal taste, and there are lots of Whoop accessories you can buy to spiff up the device for different occasions.  After just a few days, there's a lot I can still learn from the Whoop MG, but I feel like I'd personally reach for the Whoop 5.0. The range of membership options helps ensure that users don't have to break the bank, so I'd feel comfortable recommending Whoop 5.0 and Whoop MG to my friends and family. And for existing Whoop customers who are thinking about an upgrade, the extended battery life alone is worth considering.   ", "summary": null, "related_articles": [], "metadata": {"author": null, "publish_date": "2025-05-08T14:01:03+0000", "read_time": null, "keywords": "Health care industry,Internet,Technology,Breaking News: Technology,business news"}, "category": "Health and Science"}

The company began developing the prototype for its Teal Wand just over five years ago. The concept was to make cervical cancer screening more accessible via telehealth and a test that could be self-administered at home, rather than at a doctor's office. \"The pandemic showed everyone that telehealth is a thing that is preferred … and made it easier to get care for most Americans,\" said Kara Egan, CEO of Teal Health, adding that Covid also demonstrated \"at-home testing was a thing that people could handle and really understand.\" The Teal Wand works much like a tampon applicator, with a large swab that the user can insert themselves to collect a sample for testing. The FDA designated the tool as a breakthrough device after the company's clinical trial results showed the precision of the self-administered test was comparable with an in-office screening performed by a clinician, with a 96% accuracy rate. Teal plans to make the wand available in California first, starting in June. The company has had discussions with carriers about insurance coverage for the test as a preventive screening, which for most women would be covered without copays just like an annual doctor's visit. The American Cancer Society recommends women get screened for cervical cancer every three years starting at age 21. Yet Egan says 1 in 4 women fall behind on screening, in part because they can't find time for an in-person gynecologist appointment, a problem especially for women in rural areas who often have to travel beyond their community to get to a doctor.   \"This is about increasing access to care and making sure we have more options to get that care,\" she said. Ahead of its anticipated FDA approval, Teal Health raised $10 million in its latest funding round in January to help ramp up production for the launch of the Teal Wand. The investment was led by Forerunner Ventures and Laurene Powell Jobs' Emerson Collective. The company has raised a total of $23 million from investors including Serena Williams' Serena Ventures, as well as testing firm LabCorp.   The company's milestone comes as investors have grown more interested in women's health tech. Last year, there was an influx of $680 million into the space invested across 30 deals, according to data from Deloitte. About 60% of those funds went to later-stage investments, according to Jen Radin, principal in Deloitte's life sciences and health-care practice. \"From 2023 to 2024 femtech saw 41% growth, outpacing overall health tech, which grew only 10%,\" Radin said. FemHealth Ventures managing partner Maneesha Ghiya says while investors are now more cautious, in general, interest in women's health tech is moving beyond maternity and menopause.    \"Many more people are thinking about women's health more broadly and supporting these types of innovations — and that includes from the large, established players like medtech, pharma, biotech, large public companies that are thinking more broadly about women's health,\" Ghiya said.", "summary": null, "related_articles": [], "metadata": {"author": null, "publish_date": "2025-05-09T14:24:21+0000", "read_time": null, "keywords": "Business,Health care industry,Social issues,San Francisco,business news"}, "category": "Health and Science"}

{"url": "https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/11/walgreens-doubles-down-on-robots-to-fill-prescriptions-amid-turnaround.html", "source": "cnbc", "title": "Walgreens doubles down on robots to fill prescriptions amid turnaround push", "text": [], "author": null, "timestamp": null, "tags": ["health", "science", "news", "cnbc"], "content": "As   work to regain their footing,   is doubling down on  .  The company is expanding the number of retail stores served by its micro-fulfillment centers, which use robots to fill thousands of prescriptions for patients who take medications to manage or treat diabetes, high blood pressure and other conditions.  Walgreens aims to free up time for pharmacy staff, reducing their routine tasks and eliminating inventory waste. Fewer prescription fills would allow employees to interact directly with patients and perform more clinical services such as vaccinations and testing. Walgreens first rolled out the robot-powered centers in 2021, but paused expansion in 2023 to focus on gathering feedback and improving performance at existing sites. After more than a year of making upgrades, including new internal tools, the company said it is ready to expand the reach of that technology again. Walgreens told CNBC it hopes to have its 11 micro-fulfillment centers serve more than 5,000 stores by the end of the year, up from 4,800 in February and 4,300 in October 2023. As of February, the centers handled 40% of the prescription volume on average at supported pharmacies, according to Walgreens.  That translates to around 16 million prescriptions filled each month across the different sites, the company said.  The renewed automation push comes as Walgreens prepares to go private in a roughly   with Sycamore Partners, expected to close by the end of the year.  The deal would cap a turbulent chapter for Walgreens as a public company, marked by a rocky transition out of the pandemic, declining pharmacy reimbursement rates, weaker consumer spending and fierce competition from  ,   and other retail giants. Like CVS, Walgreens has shifted from opening new stores to closing hundreds of underperforming locations to shore up profits. Both companies are racing to stay relevant as online retailers lure away customers and patients increasingly opt for fast home delivery over traditional pharmacy visits. The changes also follow mounting discontent among pharmacy staff: In 2023, nationwide walkouts spotlighted burnout and chronic understaffing, forcing chains to reexamine their operational models. Walgreens said the investment in robotic pharmacy fills is already paying off. To date, micro-fulfillment centers have generated approximately $500 million in savings by cutting excess inventory and boosting efficiency, said Kayla Heffington, Walgreens' pharmacy operating model vice president. Heffington added that stores using the facilities are administering 40% more vaccines than those that aren't.  \"Right now, they're the backbone to really help us offset some of the workload in our stores, to obviously allow more time for our pharmacists and technicians to spend time with patients,\" said Rick Gates, Walgreens' chief pharmacy officer. \"It gives us a lot more flexibility to bring down costs, to increase the care and increase speed to therapy – all those things,\" he said.  Gates added that the centers give Walgreens a competitive advantage because independent pharmacies and some rivals don't have centralized support for their stores. Still,  ,   and   have similarly tested or   their own micro-fulfillment facilities to dispense grocery items and other prescriptions.  Micro-fulfillment centers come with their own risks, such as a heavy reliance on sophisticated robotics that can cause disruptions if errors occur. But the facilities are becoming a permanent fixture in retail due to the cost savings they offer and their ability to streamline workflows, reduce the burden on employees and deliver goods to customers faster. When a Walgreens retail pharmacy receives a prescription, the system determines whether it should be filled at that location or routed to a nearby micro-fulfillment center. Maintenance medications, or prescription drugs taken regularly to manage chronic health conditions, and refills that don't require immediate pickup are often sent to micro-fulfillment. At the core of each facility is a highly automated system that uses robotics, conveyor belts and barcode scanners, among other tools, to fill prescriptions. The operations are supported by a team of pharmacists pharmacy technicians and other professionals. Instead of staff members filling prescriptions by hand at stores, pill bottles move through an automated and carefully choreographed assembly line.  Pharmacy technicians fill canisters with medications for robot pods to dispense, and pharmacists verify those canisters to make sure they are accurate. Yellow robotic arms grab a labeled prescription vial and hold it up to a canister, which precisely dispenses the specific medication for that bottle. Certain prescriptions are filled at separate manual stations, including inhalers and birth control pill packs. Each prescription is then sorted and packaged for delivery back to retail pharmacy locations for final pickup. There are other security and safety measures throughout the process, said Ahlam Antar, registered group supervisor of a micro-fulfillment center in Mansfield, Massachusetts.  For example, the robot pods automatically lock and signal an error with a red-orange light if a worker attaches a canister to the wrong dispenser, preventing the incorrect pills from going in a prescription, she said.  Properly training workers at the centers to ensure accuracy and patient safety is also crucial, according to Sarah Gonsalves, a senior certified pharmacy technician at the Mansfield site.  She said a core part of her role is to make sure that technicians can correctly perform the different tasks in the process.  Antar, who has worked at the Mansfield site since its 2022 opening, said Walgreens has made improvements to the micro-fulfillment process after considering feedback from stores and patients during the paused expansion. That includes establishing new roles needed to support the process at the sites, such as a training manager for all 11 locations.  The facilities also plan to transition to using smaller prescription vials after hearing concerns that the current bottles are too large, according to a Walgreens spokesperson. They said that will allow the centers to ship more prescriptions per order and reduce costs. Heffington said the automated locations have helped reduce Walgreens' overall prescription fulfillment costs by nearly 13% compared to a year ago.  She said Walgreens has also increased prescription volume by 126% year-over-year, now filling more than 170 million prescriptions annually. The company hopes to raise that number to 180 million or even more.  Heffington added that Walgreens implemented new internal tools to track the work across all 11 centers and provide real-time data on where a patient's prescription is in the micro-fulfillment process.  \"If a patient called the store and said, 'Hey, can you tell me where my prescription is today?' [Workers] can do that with great specificity,\" thanks to the new tools, Heffington said.  Despite the company's progress, Gates said there is more work to be done with micro-fulfillment centers.  For example, he pointed to the possibility of shipping prescriptions directly to patients' doorsteps instead of putting that burden on retail stores.  \"It's only step one right now,\" he said.  Other improvements may still be needed at facilities, according to some reports. For example, WRAL News   in April that some customers at a Walgreens store in Garner, North Carolina, say they are only getting partial prescription fills, with several pills missing, or their medicine is being delayed. Before Brian Gange's Arizona store started relying on an automated facility, he walked into the pharmacy every morning knowing that a massive list of prescriptions was in his work queue waiting to be filled for the day.  Now, with help from micro-fulfillment, that list is significantly smaller each day, according to Gange.  \"We don't have to spend as much time on just those repetitive fulfillment tasks,\" he told CNBC. \"It really takes a huge weight off our shoulders.\"  Gange said that gives him and his team time to step behind the pharmacy counter and interact with customers face-to-face, answering questions, providing advice, performing health tests or administering vaccines.  That kind of attention can make all the difference for a patient.   For example, Gange recalls stepping away for five minutes to take a patient's blood pressure despite being overwhelmed with tasks while working at a different Walgreens location several years ago. He ended up sending that person to the emergency room because their blood pressure was \"off the charts.\"  That patient's wife visited the pharmacy the next day to thank Gange, saying her husband \"probably wouldn't be here with us today\" without that blood pressure test.  \"I shouldn't have to question whether I have that five or 10 minutes to check a blood pressure for a patient,\" Gange said. \"Micro-fulfillment and centralized services are really what are going to allow us to be able to do that, to have that time.\"  \"That really allows us to provide better care for them,\" he added.", "summary": null, "related_articles": [], "metadata": {"author": null, "publish_date": "2025-05-11T12:00:01+0000", "read_time": null, "keywords": "Breaking News: Business,Health care industry,Pharmaceuticals,Biotech and Pharmaceuticals,Biotechnology,Business,Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc,CVS Health Corp,Amazon.com Inc,Walmart Inc,Kroger Co,Albertsons Companies Inc,Rick Gates,Mansfield,North Carolina,business news"}, "category": "Health and Science"}

Trump signed an executive order including several different actions to renew that effort, known as the \"most favored nation\" policy. He did not refer to specific nations, but signaled that he would target other developed countries because \"there are some countries that need some additional help, and that's fine.\" \"Basically, what we're doing is equalizing,\" Trump said during a press event on Monday. \"We are going to pay the lowest price there is in the world. We will get whoever is paying the lowest price, that's the price that we're going to get.\" White House officials did not disclose which medications the order will apply to, but said it will impact the commercial market as well as Medicare and Medicaid. They said Monday's announcement will be broader than a similar policy that Trump tried to push during his first term, which only applied to Medicare Part B drugs. Officials added that the administration will have a particular focus on drugs that have the \"largest disparities and largest expenditures,\" which could include popular weight loss and diabetes treatments called GLP-1 drugs. It's unclear how effective the policy will be at lowering costs for patients. In a social media post on Monday, Trump claimed drug prices will be cut by \"59%, PLUS!\" But Trump during the press event claimed drug prices may fall even more, between 59% and 80%, or \"I guess even 90%.\" Some Wall Street analysts and other experts also questioned whether the policy can be implemented. In a note on Monday, JPMorgan analysts called the policy \"challenging to practically implement\" because it would likely require congressional approval and could run into legal hurdles. It is Trump's latest effort to try to rein in U.S. prescription drug prices, which are   in other developed nations – and up to 10 times more than in certain countries, according to the Rand Corp., a public policy think tank. In a statement on Monday, the pharmaceutical industry's biggest lobbying group, PhRMA, lauded Trump for taking aim at other nations \"not paying their fair share.\"  Still, PhRMA's CEO Stephen Ubl said \"importing foreign prices from socialist countries would be a bad deal for American patients and workers\" because it would hurt the industry's ability to bring them new treatments. Some experts have said the order could face challenges from the pharmaceutical industry in court. Despite the order, shares of U.S. drugmakers rose Monday.  's stock added more than 4%, while   and   climbed more than 2% AARP, which advocates for older Americans, thanked Trump for issuing the order in a statement on Monday.  \"For too long, big drug companies have been ripping off America's seniors—charging the highest prices in the world for lifesaving prescriptions, padding their profits at the expense of American lives, and forcing older adults to skip medications they can't afford,\" AARP's chief advocacy and engagement officer Nancy LeaMond said in the statement. Part of the order takes aim at nations abroad, which have more power to negotiate down drug prices with pharmaceutical companies. \"Starting today, the United States will no longer subsidize the health care of foreign countries, which is what we were doing,\" Trump said, adding the U.S. \"will no longer tolerate profiteering and price gouging from Big Pharma.\" He added that \"it was really the countries that forced Big Pharma to do things that, frankly, I'm not sure they really felt comfortable doing.\" The order directs the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative and the Department of Commerce to crack down on \"unreasonable and discriminatory policies\" in foreign countries that \"suppress\" drug prices abroad, the officials said. \"We are going to be working to make sure that countries aren't being unfair in their negotiations with pharmaceutical companies, right?\" one official said. Drugmakers are \"constantly complaining\" about being put \"in an untenable situation when in these negotiations\" because those companies typically have to broker drug discounts with entire countries, the official added. Unlike the U.S., several foreign countries offer universal health coverage where the government is the sole payer, giving it significant leverage to negotiate or set drug prices. White House officials said they expect drugmakers to provide discounts across the board to \"reciprocate\" the actions the Trump administration is taking to address prices abroad. Trump's order also directs the secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services to establish a pathway for U.S. patients to buy their drugs directly from manufacturers at most favored nation prices, bypassing middlemen. \"We're going to cut out the middlemen and facilitate the direct sale of drugs at the most favorite nation price, directly to the American citizen,\" Trump said. Within 30 days, the secretary will also have to set clear targets for price reductions across all markets in the U.S., according to the officials. That will open up a round of negotiations between HHS and the pharmaceutical industry, officials said, not providing exact details on the nature of those talks. If \"adequate progress\" is not made toward those price targets, HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. will impose the most favored nation pricing on drugs through rulemaking. The order also directs the Food and Drug Administration to consider expanding imports from other developed nations beyond Canada. Trump   in April directing the FDA to improve   by which states can apply to import lower-cost drugs from Canada, among other actions intended to lower drug prices. Monday's order also directs the Department of Justice and Federal Trade Commission to aggressively enforce \"anti-competitive actions\" that keep prices high in the U.S. The Department of Commerce will also consider export restrictions that \"fuel and enable that low pricing abroad.\"  Drugmakers have argued that the most favored nation policy would hurt their profits and ultimately, their ability to research and develop new medicines. White House officials contended that pharmaceutical companies will continue to make money after the price cuts if they realize that the U.S. \"alone is not going to pay for innovation\" and if they increase prices abroad to get additional revenue there. Drugmakers \"should pursue deals where they get financially rewarded commensurate the value that they are providing to other nations, health systems,\" one official said. \"Other countries should pay research and development, too. It's for their benefit,\" Trump added on Monday. The industry also lobbied against similar Trump plans during his first term. He tried to   in the final months of that term, but a federal judge  the effort   from the pharmaceutical industry. The Biden administration then rescinded that policy. White House officials   congressional Republicans to include a most favored nation provision in the major reconciliation bill they plan to pass in the coming months, but the policy would have specifically targeted Medicaid drug costs, Politico reported earlier this month. Several GOP members opposed that measure. The industry's largest trade group, PhRMA,  that Trump's Medicaid proposal could cost drugmakers as much as $1 trillion over a decade.  Some health policy experts have said a most favored nation drug policy may not be effective at lowering medication costs. For example,   the policy \"can't undo the basic economics of the global drug marketplace,\" where 70% of pharmaceutical profits worldwide come from the U.S. \"Facing a choice between deep cuts in their U.S. pricing or the loss of weakly profitable overseas markets, we can expect many firms to pull out from overseas markets at their earliest opportunity,\" experts said in a report in April.  That will leave Americans paying the same amount for medications, drugmakers with lower profits and future generations of patients with less innovation, they said. \"In sum, everyone loses,\" the experts said. Even if the drug industry pushes back on Trump's executive order in court, his administration still has another tool to push down drug prices: Medicare drug price negotiations. It's a key provision of the Inflation Reduction Act that gives Medicare the power to negotiate certain prescription drug prices with manufacturers for the first time in history. Trump last month proposed a change to that policy that drugmakers have long sought. Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle could be receptive to the idea, which proposes changing rules that differentiate between small-molecule drugs and biologic medicines. Trump last week said he plans to announce tariffs on medicines imported into the U.S. within the next two weeks.

Trump signed a sweeping executive order directing several federal agencies to renew that effort to cut prices, called the \"most favored nation\" policy. It essentially aims to tie the prices of some medicines in the U.S. to significantly lower ones abroad, or what Trump described as \"equalizing\" prices.  He did not disclose which exact medications the order will apply to, but said it will affect the commercial market as well as the public Medicare and Medicaid programs. That's broader than a similar policy proposal from Trump's first term, which was ultimately blocked in court after the pharmaceutical industry challenged it.  Trump is taking aim at a longstanding issue that past administrations have also tried to confront: U.S. prescription drug prices are   in other developed nations – and up to 10 times more than in certain countries, according to the Rand Corporation, a public policy think tank. The president claimed the order will help lower drug prices between 59% and 80%, or \"I guess even 90%.\" But health policy experts said it is still unclear how much the policy could reduce prices for patients, how much it will affect drugmakers' profits, which medicines will be targeted — and whether Trump can even put the plan into effect in the first place. Investors seemed to shrug Monday about how much the plan would hit major drugmakers. Shares of   rose 7%,   climbed 5%,  ,   and   climbed more than 3% and   rose more than 2%. JPMorgan analysts on Monday called the policy \"challenging to practically implement\" because it would likely require congressional approval and could run into legal challenges from drugmakers. Notably, several Republican lawmakers opposed including a most favored nation provision in the major economic policy bill they plan to pass in the coming months. \"The road ahead could be muddy,\" the analysts wrote in a note.  While experts backed the idea of lowering prices, they raised doubts about whether other nations and drugmakers will do what Trump hopes to accomplish with the order. \"We're unlikely to get the drug companies to voluntarily decrease their prices, and we're not going to get the other countries to voluntarily increase their prices, right?\" said Gerard Anderson, professor of health policy and management at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.  Trump's order takes aim in part at other countries, many of which have single-payer health systems with more leverage to negotiate down drug prices with manufacturers. In contrast, the U.S. has a patchwork of public and private insurance and partly relies on middlemen to set prices.  The president's policy directs the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative and the Department of Commerce to fight what the administration called \"unreasonable and discriminatory policies\" in foreign countries that \"unfairly undercut market prices and drive price hikes in the United States.\" In a statement on Monday, the pharmaceutical industry's biggest lobbying group, PhRMA, lauded Trump for taking aim at other nations for what they deemed \"not paying their fair share.\"  But other countries' governments are simply negotiating within the limits of their national health budgets, not using \"unfair\" methods like Trump claims, said Lawrence Gostin, a professor of public health law at Georgetown University. He added that they are securing fair prices for their own countries, which \"has nothing to do with undercutting the U.S.\" It's unclear what actions the U.S. could take to force other nations to take action, but Anderson said there is currently no incentive for them to hike their prices.  \"They have a system that works for them and they get lower prices. Countries like France and Switzerland are all not going to sit there and say, 'Hey, now I want to pay more,'\" he said.  The pharmaceutical industry would likely want to to see price hikes in countries within the European Union before it voluntarily lowers any drug prices in the U.S., JPMorgan analysts said. That makes other pieces of the executive order appear unlikely to come to pass. Trump's order directs the Health and Human Services secretary to establish a way for U.S. patients to buy their drugs directly from manufacturers at \"most favored nation\" prices, cutting out middlemen. The order mentions \"direct-to-consumer purchasing programs,\" without further details. His plan also calls for HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to give drugmakers price reduction targets within the next 30 days, which will open up negotiations with the companies. If \"adequate progress\" is not made toward those goals within six months of the order being signed, HHS will impose most favored nation pricing on drugs through rulemaking or \"other aggressive measures,\" according to the order. But Anderson said it would likely take far longer for the government and drugmakers to agree on a price. Under a provision of the Inflation Reduction Act, Medicare and drug manufacturers typically take six months to a year to negotiate prices.  He added, \"Why would any drug company ever lower their prices voluntarily?\" Anderson noted that the order did not provide details on the exact actions the administration could take against drugmakers who don't agree, so the incentives are unclear.  The Department of Justice and Federal Trade Commission will also take action against \"anti-competitive actions\" that keep prices high in the U.S., White House officials said.  \"There will be an expectation that those prices should come down. And then if they don't, we will be looking at our various policy levers that can be used to force those prices down,\" one official said. 'We absolutely are going to get a better deal.'\" The order also directs the Food and Drug Administration to consider expanding imports from other developed nations beyond Canada. Trump signed a separate executive order in April directing the FDA to improve the process by which states can apply to import lower-cost drugs from Canada, among other actions intended to lower drug prices. The Trump administration claims that some drug prices will fall by up to 90% \"almost immediately.\" White House officials also said the administration will have a particular focus on drugs that have the \"largest disparities and largest expenditures,\" which could include popular weight loss and diabetes treatments called GLP-1 drugs. But experts cast doubts on whether the administration can cut prices significantly, as it's still unclear which drugs and nations will be targeted, and whether other countries and drugmakers will comply.  \"We don't know the list of nations included,\" said Tricia Neuman, executive director for the program on Medicare policy at KFF, a health policy research group. \"Their pricing would make a big difference in what our prices would be, which could then affect access in the U.S.\" In Anderson's view, the order as written won't be effective at lowering drug prices.  \"It's a great idea to pay international prices, but it's how you get to implement it. There are no details and ability to effectuate it,\" he said.  Gostin also added that Americans will likely not see lower prices \"in the foreseeable future.\"  Still, AARP, which advocates for older Americans, thanked Trump for issuing the order in a statement on Monday. \"It's safe to say that we are excited about any attempts to help bring down prescription drug prices,\" said Leigh Purvis, the prescription drug policy principal in AARP's Public Policy Institute. \"This approach is unusually understandable to the public because I think there's a general understanding that America does pay the highest prescription drug prices in the world.\" She added that the \"devil is in the details, and that's what we're looking forward to seeing more of.\" The pharmaceutical industry has argued that a \"most favored nation\" policy will hurt its profits and ability to research and develop new drugs. Last week, PhRMA even  that Trump's proposal – if applied to the Medicaid program specifically – could cost drugmakers as much as $1 trillion over a decade.  But Monday's executive order seems to be \"more of a headline risk\" than the sweeping shift for the pharmaceutical industry many had feared, BMO Capital Markets analyst Evan Seigerman said in a note on Monday.  He pointed to the uncertain path forward for the plan, saying it \"could be more rhetoric than actual implementable policy.\" Seigerman added that Trump appeared to be somewhat sympathetic to U.S. manufacturers, with the president arguing that European nations are not supporting drug research and development due to their lower prices.  Anderson said the pharmaceutical industry may be breathing a \"sigh of relief today,\" pending further details on what the administration's retaliatory actions could look like.  Trump's order suggests that it is ultimately voluntary for drugmakers to lower prices and, subsequently, profits, so \"he did not propose something that is mandatory and really has teeth here.\" Still, while PhRMA agreed with Trump's decision to target other countries, the group emphasized that \"importing foreign prices from socialist countries would be a bad deal for American patients and workers. \"It would mean less treatments and cures and would jeopardize the hundreds of billions our member companies are planning to invest in America – threatening jobs, hurting our economy and making us more reliant on China for innovative medicines,\" the group said in a statement. Some analysts and experts said Trump could alternatively implement his most favored nation policy through an existing tool to push down drug prices:  . It's a key provision of the Biden administration's Inflation Reduction Act that gives Medicare the power to negotiate certain prescription drug prices with manufacturers. The federal program is currently in its   of talks with drugmakers. The Trump administration could use the \"most favored nation\" price for a given drug as the initial offer to manufacturers at the beginning of negotiations, Anderson said. \"You'd be starting the negotiation at an even lower price than they have in the past,\" he said, adding that it would not require any help from Congress. JPMorgan analysts added that \"we see a clearer pathway for the administration to implement [the most favored nation policy] at a smaller scale through Medicare IRA price negotiations, where the impact would be limited to a small number of drugs\" and make the hit to drugmaker profits more gradual.", "summary": null, "related_articles": [], "metadata": {"author": null, "publish_date": "2025-05-12T19:54:25+0000", "read_time": null, "keywords": "Breaking News: Business,Health care industry,Pharmaceuticals,Biotech and Pharmaceuticals,Biotechnology,Business,United States,Donald Trump,Social issues,Donald J.

The federal government and some state legislatures are increasingly drawing attention to what they claim are the risks associated with fluoride, a mineral that's been used for decades in community water systems, toothpastes and mouth rinses to prevent tooth decay.

The process was established under the Biden administration's signature Inflation Reduction Act as a way to rein in high health care costs for older Americans.  CMS plans to announce a list of 15 drugs eligible for the third round of price talks by February 2026, which will then kick off months of back and forth between the government and manufacturers if they agree to participate. The new negotiated prices for those products will go into effect in 2028.

But Wall Street analysts are focused on another part of the guidance that could cause issues for  ,   and some other pharmaceutical companies.  The guidance document suggests that the Trump administration could end a workaround that those companies are using to drag out revenue from top-earning cancer drugs, such as Merck's Keytruda and Bristol Myers Squibb's Opdivo. The plan had been to shift patients to newer injectable – or subcutaneous – versions of their cancer drugs and keep charging Medicare higher prices for them, even after their original intravenous versions are subject to new negotiated prices under the program. Drugmakers have been banking on those subcutaneous versions as a way to dampen the revenue they would lose from Medicare drug price negotiations, along with upcoming patent expirations for the original forms of their drugs. For example, key patents for Keytruda start expiring in 2028.  Under the current rules, complex drugs known as biologics are eligible for the negotiation process after 13 years, but the clock restarts for a new version of the drug – like a subcutaneous form – that adds an additional active ingredient. Subcutaneous versions of drugs like Opdivo are combination products that include an additional ingredient, allowing them to be injected quickly instead of being slowly infused like the original intravenous form. But on Monday, CMS said it is \"soliciting comments\" on how it \"might consider\" grouping these combination drugs with their original versions — if the added ingredient doesn't affect how the drug treats the underlying disease. In other words, the agency is considering whether to count two versions of a drug as a single product in certain cases.  That appears to be \"somewhat targeted\" at products such as subcutaneous Keytruda and Opdivo, JPMorgan analysts said in a note on Monday. They said the guidance leads to \"at least the potential for inclusion\" of those drugs in future negotiations.  Still, no changes are final yet, so it may be too soon to predict the impact on drugmakers like Merck and Bristol Myers Squibb.  Feel free to send any tips, suggestions, story ideas and data to Annika at  .

OpenAI on Monday launched a new evaluation tool called HealthBench, a benchmark that will help test how artificial intelligence models perform in realistic health-care scenarios.  \"If developed and deployed effectively, large language models have the potential to expand access to health information, support clinicians in delivering high-quality care, and help people advocate for their health and that of their communities,\" OpenAI said in a  . \"To get there, we need to ensure models are useful and safe.\" The company said HealthBench was developed alongside 262 doctors from 60 countries. It's based on 5,000 conversations that simulate interactions between individual users or clinicians and AI models. The discussions are split into seven different themes, including global health, emergency situations and handling uncertainty.  When a model responds to a prompt, each response is graded against a set of \"physician-written rubric criteria specific to that conversation,\" OpenAI said. HealthBench contains 48,562 unique rubric criteria. OpenAI included one example where a user said they found their 70-year-old neighbor unresponsive on the floor. The AI model in that instance told the user to take action right away, and included eight steps they could follow. HealthBench gave this answer a 77% based on its rubric criteria.  OpenAI said HealthBench responses were evaluated against responses written by doctors to understand how the model compared to their clinical judgement. The company found that HealthBench \"closely aligns\" with physicians' grading.  OpenAI said it used HealthBench to evaluate several existing models, including its own o3, GPT-4.1, o1, GPT-4o and GPT-3.5 Turbo models, xAI's Grok 3, Google's Gemini 2.5 Pro, Anthropic's Claude 3.7 Sonnet and Meta's Llama 4 Maverick.  The company found that o3 outperformed other models, and it said its models have improved by 28% on HealthBench.  OpenAI said the full evaluation suite and underlying data for HealthBench is available in its GitHub repository.  \"We hope this supports shared progress toward using AI systems to improve human health,\" the company said.

Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., said,   to pray for Biden and his family. \"This is certainly sad news, and the Johnson family will be joining the countless others who are praying for the former President in the wake of his diagnosis,\"  .
