It comes after a turbulent 2024 for health insurers, hurt by lower government payments, soaring medical costs and public backlash after the   of UnitedHealthcare's top executive, Brian Thompson. UnitedHealthcare, the insurance arm of UnitedHealth Group, is the nation's largest provider of those plans. Shares of competitor   fell 5%, while   dropped more than 1% and   tumbled 2%.   has no Medicare Advantage business. Its stock was up almost 1% on Thursday. UnitedHealth's first-quarter results reveal \"ominous signs\" of accelerating medical costs in Medicare Advantage businesses, TD Cowen analyst Ryan Langston said in a note Thursday. He added that the company \"correctly foreshadowed\" increasing medical costs back in 2023, so Thursday's comments \"will call into question\" the full-year outlooks for every insurer.  Higher medical costs have dogged the entire insurance industry over the past year as more seniors return to hospitals to undergo procedures they had delayed during the Covid-19 pandemic, such as joint and hip replacements. But the issue had previously not been as significant at UnitedHealthcare. Barclays analyst Andrew Mok said UnitedHealth's problems may be less of an issue for companies that made \"significant\" exits from some Medicare Advantage markets, including Humana and CVS, according to a note Thursday. Many insurers last year   due to higher medical costs and lower reimbursement rates from the federal government.  Meanwhile, the issue could be a bigger deal for companies that gained greater market share in Medicare Advantage, such as Elevance Health and  , according to Mok. UnitedHealth said the rise in care use, or utilization, in its Medicare Advantage business came in far above what the company planned for the year, which was for care activity to increase at a rate consistent with what it saw in 2024. But trends that became apparent toward the end of the first quarter suggest that care activity increased \"at twice\" that level, UnitedHealth Group CEO Andrew Witty said during an earnings call on Thursday.  The jump was particularly notable in doctor and outpatient services, which do not involve overnight hospital stays, he added.  \"It's very, very unusual,\" Lance Wilkes, Bernstein senior equity analyst,   CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" on Thursday. He said rising utilization is \"really surprising\" coming off the high level of care activity that the industry saw over the past year. Wilkes added that UnitedHealth and the broader industry may be \"pulling back\" the \"intensity of some of the activity they do to manage utilization,\" which causes dissatisfaction among patients. For example, some insurers require prior authorization, which makes providers obtain approval from a patient's insurance company before administering specific treatments. \"I think it's probably United pulling back because of the policy headwinds and the scrutiny on the company,\" Wilkes said. \"I do think the horrible thing that happened to Brian Thompson and the company is a part of this, and I think it's reflective of also the Department of Justice scrutiny on United over the last couple years.\" UnitedHealth is reportedly grappling with a   of its Medicare billing practices. Also on Thursday, UnitedHealth pointed to issues related to changes in the profile of patients treated under its Optum health-care unit. That segment includes its pharmacy benefit manager, which negotiates drug rebates with manufacturers on behalf of insurers and maintains formularies, among other responsibilities.  But Witty said the company is taking action to improve results and considers the issues related to Optum and elevated medical costs \"highly addressable as we look ahead to 2026.\"  If nothing else, insurers are set to get a boost next year.

The company's BCI will initially be used to help patients with severe paralysis restore functions such as speech and movement, according to its  .

Rapoport also helped co-found Musk's Neuralink in 2017 before departing the following year. The piece of Precision's system that the FDA approved is called the Layer 7 Cortical Interface. The microelectrode array is thinner than a human hair and resembles a piece of yellow scotch tape. Each array is made up of 1,024 electrodes that can record, monitor and stimulate electrical activity on the brain's surface. When it is placed on the brain, Precision says it can conform to the surface without damaging any tissue. The FDA authorized Layer 7 to be implanted in patients for up to 30 days, and Precision will be able to market the technology for use in clinical settings. This means surgeons will be able to use the array during procedures to map brain signals, for instance. It is not Precision's end goal for the technology, but it will help the company generate revenue in the near term. Precision has temporarily implanted the Layer 7 in 37 patients so far, and   one case at the Mount Sinai Hospital in New York last April.

He proposed a change that the pharmaceutical industry has long sought. In the wide-ranging order, Trump directed Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to work with Congress to modify a piece of the Medicare drug price negotiation rules, which differentiate between small-molecule drugs and biologic medicines. Currently, the law essentially spares biologics like vaccines from new negotiated prices for 13 years after they receive U.S. approval, compared with just nine years for small-molecule drugs that come in a pill or tablet form. The industry contends that the discrepancy – or what drugmakers call the \"pill penalty\" – discourages companies from investing in the development of small-molecule drugs, which are generally cheaper, easier to manufacture and more convenient for patients to take.  Trump's executive order  , saying the discrepancy \"threatens to distort innovation.\" Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle could be receptive to the proposed change, especially after some   last year that also seeks to eliminate the difference.  It could have huge implications for drugmakers, patients and Medicare's spending on prescription drugs. An   from the health policy research organization KFF said the change would mean small-molecule drugs would be on the market longer before they are eligible for negotiations, which could lead to an increase in Medicare prescription drug spending, higher medication prices and steeper premiums in Medicare Part D plans.  Changing the law \"would come at a cost to Medicare and beneficiaries by giving drug companies 4 additional years of setting their own prices on these drugs prior to being eligible for negotiation by the federal government, unless combined with other changes to prevent higher spending,\" the analysis said.  More than half of the drugs – 13 out of 25 – in the first and second rounds of negotiations would have been ineligible at the time they were selected if the discrepancy between small-molecule treatments and biologics didn't exist, according to KFF. Those 13 drugs accounted for about two-thirds of total gross Medicare Part D spending on the 25 treatments, or $61 billion out of $91 billion, KFF said.  That includes the blood thinner Eliquis from   and  , as well as the Type 2 diabetes treatment Jardiance from Eli Lilly and Boehringer Ingelheim.   would be \"among the biggest beneficiaries\" if the pill penalty is removed, according to a Thursday note from TD Cowen analyst Michael Nedelcovych. At the top of the list of drugs   are the company's blockbuster diabetes injection Ozempic, weight loss shot Wegovy and diabetes pill Rybelsus, which are considered one product for the sake of the negotiations since they all share the same active ingredient, semaglutide. Without the so-called pill penalty, Ozempic, Wegovy and Rybelsus would not be eligible until 2031, which is only one year before patent expiration in the U.S., Nedelcovych said.  Trump's   wasn't all good news for pharma. Analysts pointed out that it contained other proposals that the pharmaceutical industry has strongly opposed.  For example, it calls on the Food and Drug Administration to open up a pathway for more drug imports from Canada, where prescription medications are far cheaper. That was an element of Trump's first-term agenda, and appears to clash with his planned tariffs on pharmaceuticals.  In a note on Tuesday, BMO Capital Markets analyst Evan Seigerman added that \"we're also not out of the woods on tariffs, FDA, or the potential for further drug pricing reform.\" He is referring to the massive overhaul at the FDA and other federal health agencies under Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who now leads the Department of Health and Human Services.  \"While we are encouraged with this [executive order,] we're cautious as to what comes next from the Trump Administration for BioPharma,\" Seigerman said.  We'll be sure to cover any of Trump's other moves, so stay tuned.  Feel free to send any tips, suggestions, story ideas and data to Annika at  .

For readers like this health tech reporter who spend a lot of time thinking, researching and talking about the U.S. health-care system, it can be easy to forget that Epic Systems is not a household name for most Americans.  Many people are familiar with Epic because of its patient portal MyChart, but most of them aren't as aware of the central role its technology plays within the broader health-care industry. Epic's software is used by more than 65,000 clinics and 2,900 hospitals, including the vast majority of major health systems in the U.S.  The company is a health-care technology giant, but it's notoriously private, and that's largely by design. Epic has no marketing department and it doesn't advertise, according to its CEO and founder Judy Faulkner. It never has.  To give you a sense of how the company feels about marketing, Epic declared it would replace all of its developers with marketing staff as an   year. \"During its 43-year history of creating award-winning healthcare software, Epic has prided itself on having a staff that's heavily focused on research and development and not focused on marketing. But times are changing, and Epic needs to keep up,\" the fake announcement reads. Faulkner rarely does media appearances, and for the most part, Epic has largely tried to keep its head down over the years.  In recent weeks, however, the company appears to have started to change its posture. Epic started posting on the social media platform X, coincidentally, on April Fools' Day. The company confirmed the authenticity of the account to CNBC.  Seth Hain, senior vice president of research and development at Epic, participated in a podcast with Julie Yoo, general partner at the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, that was released last week. Andreessen Horowitz is one of the most high-profile firms in Silicon Valley, but Epic has never accepted any investment from venture capitalists.

The podcast is the No. 1 Technology show on Apple Podcasts and Spotify and reaches more than 1 million listeners, according to its website. It's hard to know exactly how much Epic assisted with the research for the episode, but the hosts do mention that the company confirmed some facts.  Taken together, these developments suggest that Epic is at least exploring a more public-facing persona.

The Food and Drug Administration is phasing out the use of petroleum-based synthetic dyes by the end of next year, the agency announced on Tuesday. \"For the last 50 years, American children have increasingly been living in a toxic soup of synthetic chemicals,\" FDA Commissioner Marty Makary said at a press conference. Food and beverage companies use additives like red dye 40 to give cereal, chips, sports drinks and other products bright hues that attract shoppers. But backlash against artificial colorants has been brewing in the U.S. for more than a decade. The changes will affect a slew of food giants, including  ,  , Mars and  . The industry has argued that the claims about the dangers of artificial dyes lack evidence that would support any bans. As of Tuesday, the FDA and the food industry don't have a formal agreement to remove artificial dyes but instead \"an understanding,\" according to Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. It is unclear what enforcement actions the agency would take if food and beverage companies do not comply. \"There are a number of tools at our disposal,\" Makary said. \"I believe in love, let's start in a friendly way and see if we can do this without any statutory or regulatory changes, but we are exploring every tool in the toolbox to make sure this gets done very quickly. And they want to do it — so why go down a complicated road with Congress?\" The FDA is taking several actions, including setting a \"national standard\" and timeline for the food industry to transition from petroleum-based food dyes to natural alternatives, according to Makary. The agency is also initiating a process to revoke authorization of synthetic food colorings, including those not in production, within the coming weeks. He added that the FDA is also eliminating the remaining six synthetic dyes on the market from the U.S. food supply by the end of the year, specifically red dye 40, yellow dye 5, yellow dye 6, blue dye 1, blue dye 2 and green dye 2. It is also requesting food companies to phase out red dye 3 by the end of next year, which is sooner than the 2027 to 2028 deadline previously announced, according to Makary. \"For companies that are currently using petroleum based red dye, try watermelon juice or beet juice. For companies currently combining petroleum-based yellow chemical and red dyes together, try carrot juice,\" he said.  Makary added that the agency plans to authorize four additional color additives using natural ingredients in the coming weeks, while also expediting the review and approval of other natural ingredient colors. Makary cited a   that concluded that artificial colors in the diet \"result in increased hyperactivity.\" \"The F in FDA stands for food,\" he said. \"Now, there's no one ingredient that accounts for the child chronic disease epidemic. And let's be honest, taking petroleum-based food dyes out of the food supply is not a silver bullet that will instantly make America's children healthy, but it is one important step.\" Last month, Kennedy   that removing artificial dyes from the food system is an urgent priority of the Trump administration. Meeting attendees included the CEOs of PepsiCo North America, Kraft Heinz, General Mills, Tyson Foods, WK Kellogg, J.M. Smucker and the Consumer Brands Association, the industry's top trade group. Kennedy has used Kellogg's Froot Loops as his primary example when railing against artificial colorants. While it is unclear exactly how removing dyes could affect the companies' businesses, it will be a major effort to overhaul recipes — and the new looks could affect how consumers perceive the products. Makary said phasing out petroleum-based food dyes won't increase food prices, pointing to other countries that have made similar moves. However, synthetic dyes are generally more cost-effective than natural alternatives, which often require larger quantities to achieve vibrant colors and can carry higher production costs, according to some  and  . Previously, pushback from consumer advocates led some of the companies to tweak their formulas and drop artificial dyes without any government intervention.

The naturally dyed cereal, which used turmeric, radishes and purple carrots, was not as vibrant, and customers rejected the new version. Kennedy is   that oversees food and tobacco products,   and other medicines, scientific research, public health infrastructure and government-funded health care. After just two months on the job, he has drastically changed the nation's federal health agencies.  In March, he announced  to slash 10,000 full-time employees across different departments and consolidate divisions. He has cut back crucial parts of HHS, including offices that handle HIV prevention efforts and work to  . The Food and Drug Administration is also   for testing fluid milk and other dairy products due to reduced capacity in its food safety and nutrition division, Reuters reported on Tuesday. Kennedy's so-called Make America Healthy Again platform argues a corrupt alliance of drug and food companies and the federal health agencies that regulate them are making Americans less healthy. He has pledged to end the chronic disease epidemic in children and adults, and has been vocal about  , rather than drugs, central to that goal. In January, before President Donald Trump or Kennedy took office, the Food and Drug Administration   of one type of red food dye called Red No. 3. The dye is known to cause cancer in laboratory animals, but food manufacturers were allowed to use it for years because scientists didn't believe it raised the risk of cancer in humans at the level it is typically consumed. At least one company is benefitting from the ban on artificial dyes:  , which helps companies tweak their flavors and formulas. \"Now, reformulation activity has always been a part of the work that we do with our customer base, and we've been doing that for quite some time, but we are seeing a tick up in reformulation activity,\" McCormick CEO Brendan Foley told analysts on the company's earnings call in late March, adding that companies are seeking help cutting both artificial colors and sodium from their products.", "summary": null, "related_articles": [], "metadata": {"author": null, "publish_date": "2025-04-22T20:22:17+0000", "read_time": null, "keywords": "Restaurants,Food and drink,Business,Biotechnology,Biotech and Pharmaceuticals,Pharmaceuticals,Health care industry,Breaking News: Business,Social issues,PepsiCo Inc.,Donald Trump,Kraft Heinz Co,General Mills Inc,Tyson Foods Inc,WK Kellogg Co,McCormick & Company Inc,Robert F.

In lawsuits filed Wednesday, Lilly accuses the sites — Mochi Health, Fella Health, Willow Health and Henry Meds — of deceiving consumers about \"untested, unapproved drugs\" and turning them away from Lilly's medicines. Lilly alleges the companies are claiming to offer personalized options when they are actually mass-marketing slightly different versions of Lilly's drugs in order to skirt FDA rules. Lilly also claims some of the sites are selling formulations of the drugs that haven't been studied, such as oral tablets and drops. Fella, Willow and Henry Meds didn't immediately respond to CNBC's requests for comment. Mochi Health in a statement said its model \"remains compliant with FDA guidance and pharmacy regulations.\"  Lilly's diabetes drug Mounjaro went into short supply in late 2022, allowing pharmacies and outsourcing facilities to produce the treatment, a practice called compounding. Novo Nordisk's weight loss drug Wegovy was also in short supply, opening up the market for compounding GLP-1s. That business boomed online, where people sought versions of the treatments if they couldn't find the brand names or couldn't get them covered by insurance. Mass compounding of tirzepatide, the active ingredient in Mounjaro and Zepbound, was supposed to stop last month after the Food and Drug Administration declared the shortage of the drugs over. Some pharmacies kept doing it anyway, producing versions that differ slightly from the brand name, which could possibly keep them out of the FDA's crosshairs.

Asked whether she feared legal action from Lilly, Ahmad said she wasn't worried about her prescribers since \"they have established patient-physician relationships\" and \"the beauty of medicine is really that they get full autonomy to decide what is the best way to manage their patients.\" Lilly in its filing Wednesday claimed Ahmad is not a licensed physician and that Mochi and its \"unlicensed owners exercise undue influence and control over, among other things, the prescribing decisions of physicians\" and as a result engage in the \"unlawful corporate practice of medicine.\" Ahmad in a statement said the use of compounded medications \"remains appropriate and legal when tailored to individual patient needs and prescribed by a licensed medical provider\" and that Mochi's physicians choose which treatments are best for their patients. She said she holds a doctor of medicine degree but is not practicing as CEO of Mochi. Lilly makes a similar allegation against Fella Health, accusing the company of making \"sweeping corporate decisions that dictate patient care, such as when Fella changed patients en masse from one tirzepatide formulation to another with additives.\" In all four cases, Lilly is seeking to stop the sites from marketing or selling tirzepatide.

The company now expects its 2025 adjusted earnings to come in between $8.82 and $8.97, down slightly from a previous outlook of $8.88 to $9.03 per share. The company said the expected tariff charge primarily reflects levies between the U.S. and China, and Canada and Mexico to a lesser degree. Merck has built a robust presence in China, which is considered one of the company's most important markets and is home to some of its partners and manufacturing and research and development sites.  Merck noted that the new outlook does not account for President  's planned tariffs on pharmaceuticals imported into the U.S., which are prompting some drugmakers to   footprints.  That includes Merck, which has invested $12 billion in U.S. manufacturing and research and development and expects to put more than $9 billion more into the country by the end of 2028. On an earnings call on Thursday, Merck CEO Rob Davis said that \"as you look at 2025, we're well positioned with inventory to be able to mitigate anything we could see in the short term.\" He added that in the medium to long term, \"we've already started to identify where we can either reposition our own manufacturing,\" which could look like changing the priorities of existing plants, or bring on external manufacturing to \"bridge gaps\" and build internal production further. \"In many ways, we are aligned with what the administration is wanting to do, and feel that we're in position to be able to do that quite effectively,\" he said. The new guidance does include a one-time charge of roughly 6 cents per share related to the company's license agreement with Hengrui Pharma, which it   in March. Merck reiterated its full-year sales forecast of between $64.1 billion and $65.6 billion.  Also on Thursday, the drugmaker reported first-quarter revenue and profit that beat expectations, as it said it saw strength in its oncology portfolio and animal health products.  Merck also cited \"increasingly meaningful\" sales contributions from two recently launched drugs. They are Winrevair, which is used to treat a rare, deadly lung condition, and Capvaxive, a vaccine designed to protect adults from a bacteria known as pneumococcus that can cause serious illnesses and lung infection.  Sales of those drugs will likely be critical to Merck's efforts to offset losses from its top-selling cancer therapy Keytruda, which will lose exclusivity in 2028.  Here's what Merck reported for the first quarter compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:  The company posted net income of $5.08 billion, or $2.01 per share, for the quarter. That compares with net income of $4.76 billion, or $1.87 per share, during the year-earlier period.  Excluding acquisition and restructuring costs, Merck earned $2.22 per share for the first quarter.  Merck raked in $15.53 billion in revenue for the quarter, down 2% from the same period a year ago. Merck's pharmaceutical unit, which develops a wide range of drugs, booked $13.64 billion in revenue during the first quarter. That's down 3% from the same period a year ago. Keytruda recorded $7.21 billion in revenue during the quarter, up just 4% from the year-earlier period.  That increase was driven by higher uptake of Keytruda for earlier-stage cancers and strong demand for the drug for metastatic cancers, which spread to other parts of the body. Still, sales came under the $7.43 billion that analysts had expected, according to StreetAccount estimates.   Notably, Merck continued to see   of Gardasil, a vaccine that prevents cancer from HPV, the most common sexually transmitted infection in the U.S.  In February, Merck announced a decision to halt shipments of Gardasil into China beginning that month and going through at least mid-2025. Investors will likely be looking for updates on that effort during the earnings call on Thursday.  The Chinese market makes up the majority of the blockbuster shot's international revenue. Merck is hoping that Gardasil's expanded approval for men ages 9 to 26 in China will help boost uptake of the vaccine. Gardasil raked in $1.33 billion in sales, down 41% from the first quarter of 2024 primarily due to lower demand in China. That's below the $1.45 billion that analysts were expecting, according to StreetAccount estimates.  China has retaliated with tariffs of 125% on goods from the U.S. Some experts said China's tariffs on U.S. products could lead to increased prices or limited supply of some popular Western medicines for Chinese patients, Reuters  . Merck's animal health division, which develops vaccines and medicines for dogs, cats and cattle, posted nearly $1.59 billion in sales, up 5% from the same period a year ago.

The company now expects 2025 revenue to come in between $45.8 billion and $46.8 billion, up from a   of around $45.5 billion. Bristol Myers also projects full-year adjusted earnings of $6.70 to $7 per share, which compares with its prior forecast of $6.55 to $6.85 per share.  Notably, the company said its guidance revisions include the estimated impact of current tariffs on U.S. products shipped to China. China is a critical market for Bristol Myers. The company has   its \"China 2030 Strategy,\" which is a   to bring more of its medicines to the nation to address unmet medical needs in areas like gastric cancer and include more Chinese patients in clinical trials. But the new outlooks do not account for any of President  s planned tariffs on pharmaceuticals imported into the U.S., Bristol Myers said.  In an earnings call Thursday, Bristol Myers Squibb CEO Christopher Boerner said the company appreciated the Trump administration's efforts to increase U.S. manufacturing, but noted that it \"needs to be done in a very thoughtful and deliberate way\" in the pharmaceutical sector. He added that it is \"simply too early to provide a lot more\" on the company's expectations for pharmaceutical-specific tariffs. Still, Bristol Myers is continuing \"mitigation efforts\" to reduce risks of any disruption to the supply chain and shortages, Boerner said. \"We have a tremendous amount of flexibility to be able to move our manufacturing around should any potential tariffs come up,\" said the company's CFO David Elkins on the call. He added that Bristol Myers has a broad global manufacturing network, which includes a significant presence in the U.S. Bristol Myers said the outlook hike reflects strength in its portfolio of newer drug brands, and better-than-anticipated first-quarter sales from its legacy portfolio of older medications.  The results come as Bristol Myers moves to slash $2 billion in expenses by the end of 2027, which is on top of $1.5 billion in planned cost cuts by the end of this year.  It also comes just days after Bristol Myers' recently approved schizophrenia drug, Cobenfy,  , leading some Wall Street analysts to substantially lower their multibillion-dollar sales forecasts for the treatment.   The company is banking on Cobenfy and other so-called growth portfolio drugs to offset the loss in revenue from top-selling treatments slated to lose exclusivity on the market, including its blockbuster blood thinner Eliquis and cancer immunotherapy Opdivo.  Boerner said \"there's a lot of uncertainty, whether related to tariffs, a potential economic downturn or restructuring at the FDA and HHS.\" He is referring to the Trump administration's efforts to   the Food and Drug Administration and other federal health agencies under the Department of Health and Human Services. But the company remains confident in its ability \"to deliver for our patients, employees and shareholders,\" he said. Here is what Bristol Myers reported for the first quarter compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:  Bristol Myers posted net income of $2.5 billion, or $1.20 per share, for the first quarter. That compares with a net loss of $11.9 billion, or a loss of $5.89 per share, for the year-earlier period.  Excluding certain items, it reported adjusted earnings per share of $1.80 for the quarter.  The pharmaceutical giant's revenue fell 6% from the same period a year ago to $11.2 billion.  Eliquis booked $3.57 billion in sales for the quarter, down 4% from the year-ago period. That is above the $3.34 billion that analysts were expecting, according to estimates compiled by StreetAccount. The blood thinner, which Bristol Myers shares with  , is expected to lose market exclusivity by 2028.  Sales of Eliquis could also take a hit in 2026, when a   for the drug goes into effect for certain Medicare patients following negotiations with the federal government. Those price talks are a key provision of the Inflation Reduction Act. The   targets 15 additional drugs and will set new prices that will go into effect in 2028. That includes the Bristol Myers medication Pomalyst, which is used to treat a blood cancer called multiple myeloma and a different cancer that develops in people with HIV. Pomalyst brought in $658 million for the period, down 24% from a year earlier. Revlimid, a drug used to treat adults with multiple myeloma, took in $936 million in sales for the first quarter, down 44% from the same period a year ago.   Revenue from the company's so-called growth portfolio was $5.56 billion for the first quarter, up 16% from the year-earlier period.  Opdivo brought in $2.27 billion in revenue for the first quarter, rising 9% from the year-earlier period. That is above analysts' estimate of $2.16 billion for the quarter, StreetAccount said.

That came in response to a February lawsuit from a compounding trade group against the Food and Drug Administration's determination that the active ingredient in those drugs, semaglutide, is no longer in shortage in the U.S. Patients flocked to the cheaper copycats when Ozempic and Wegovy were in short supply over the last two years due to skyrocketing demand, or if they didn't have insurance coverage for the costly treatments.  During  , pharmacists can legally make compounded versions of brand-name medications. Many telehealth companies, such as  , also offered those copycats. But drugmakers and some health experts have pushed back against the practice because the FDA does not approve compounded drugs, which are essentially custom-made copies prescribed by a doctor to meet a specific patient's needs.  \"We are pleased the court has rejected the compounders' attempts to undermine FDA's data-based decision that the shortage\" of semaglutide is resolved, said Steve Benz, Novo Nordisk's corporate vice president, legal and U.S. general counsel, in a statement.  \"Patient safety remains a top priority for Novo Nordisk and the extensive nationwide legal actions we have taken to protect Americans from the health risks posed by illegitimate 'semaglutide' drugs are working,\" he said, referring to the company's more than 100 lawsuits against compounding pharmacies and other entities across 32 states.  On Thursday, U.S. District Judge Mark Pittman specifically denied the Outsourcing Facilities Association's bid for a preliminary injunction that would have prevented the FDA from taking action against its members for making copies of semaglutide.  That decision upholds the FDA's previous determination that the semaglutide shortage in the U.S. is over and means the FDA can now immediately go after so-called 503A pharmacies that are making compounded versions of semaglutide according to individual prescriptions for a specific patient. Those pharmacies are largely regulated by states rather than the FDA. The decision also means the FDA can start targeting federally regulated 503B pharmacies, which manufacture compounded drugs in bulk with or without prescriptions, after May 22. The agency's actions can include product seizures and warning letters to pharmacies.  The decision on Thursday follows another win for Novo Nordisk. A different federal judge in Texas earlier this week ruled in favor of the drugmaker against a 503A pharmacy, MediOak Pharmacy, permanently prohibiting the business from marketing or selling compounded semaglutide.

The FDA declared the U.S. shortage of tirzepatide over last year, prompting the same compounding trade group to sue the FDA over the drug.  In March, a federal judge denied the compounding group's request for a preliminary injunction on the FDA's enforcement against its members for making copies of Mounjaro and Zepbound.

The company previously said its cost-cutting program would deliver overall net cost savings of roughly $4.5 billion by the end of 2025. On Tuesday, Pfizer said it now expects additional savings of roughly $1.2 billion, primarily in selling, informational and administrative expenses, by the end of 2027.  The company said that will be driven in large part by \"enhanced digital enablement,\" including automation and artificial intelligence and streamlining business processes. The expanded cuts also include expected research and development reorganization cost savings of around $500 million by the end of 2026, the company added. Those savings will be reinvested into Pfizer's product pipeline.  Pfizer has a  to slash costs, with the first phase of the effort slated to deliver $1.5 billion in savings by the end of 2027. With the added cuts announced Tuesday, Pfizer now expects to deliver around $7.7 billion in savings by the end of that year from the two cost-cutting efforts. The cuts aim to help the pharmaceutical giant recover from the rapid decline of its Covid business and stock price over the last few years, and appear to be paying off. Here's what the company reported for the   compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:  The results come as drugmakers brace for President  's planned tariffs on pharmaceuticals imported into the U.S. – his administration's bid to boost U.S. manufacturing of medications.  Unlike other companies grappling with evolving trade policy, Pfizer did not revise its outlook. The company maintained its full-year 2025 outlook, forecasting sales of $61 billion to $64 billion, with a similar performance from its Covid products as seen in 2024, however Pfizer noted in its earnings release that the guidance \"does not currently include any potential impact related to future tariffs and trade policy changes, which we are unable to predict at this time.\" But on the earnings call on Tuesday, Pfizer executives said the guidance does reflect $150 million in costs from Trump's existing tariffs. \"Included in our guidance that we didn't really speak about is there are some tariffs in place today,\" Pfizer CFO Dave Denton said on the call. \"We are contemplating that within our guidance range and we continue to again trend to the top end of our guidance range even with those costs to be incurred this year,\" he said. On the call, Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla said the company established a team to analyze a range of potential outcomes and develop strategies to help mitigate the potential impact of tariffs on its business in the short and long term. That team is managing current inventory levels in certain jurisdictions and leveraging Pfizer's domestic manufacturing footprint, among other efforts. \"Should we be impacted by further tariffs in the future, we will assess the impact of the policies enacted and provide information at the appropriate time,\" Bourla said. He added that uncertainty around Trump's pharmaceutical tariffs is deterring the company from further investing in U.S. manufacturing and research and development. Pfizer still expects that   resulting from the Inflation Reduction Act will hurt sales by $1 billion, dampening growth by approximately 1.6% compared with 2024. Stripping out one-time items, the company expects 2025 earnings to be in the range of $2.80 to $3 a share.  \"With the underlying strength of our business, we believe we can be agile in navigating an uncertain and volatile external environment,\" Bourla said in a release. For the first quarter, the company booked net income of $2.97 billion, or 52 cents per share. That compares with net income of $3.12 billion, or 55 cents per share, during the same period a year ago.  Excluding certain items, including restructuring charges and costs associated with intangible assets, the company posted earnings per share of 92 cents for the quarter. Pfizer reported revenue of $13.72 billion for the first quarter, down 8% from the same period a year ago. The company said the decrease in sales was primarily driven by a decline in revenue for Paxlovid, which posted $491 million in sales during the first quarter, down 76% from the same period a year ago, in part due to lower Covid infections worldwide and reduced international government purchases of the drug. The drop in sales also reflects a boost Pfizer got in the first quarter of 2024 from a final adjustment related to a previously recorded revenue reversal for Paxlovid.  Analysts had expected Paxlovid to generate $769.7 million in sales for the first quarter, according to StreetAccount estimates. Meanwhile, the company's Covid shot, Comirnaty, booked $565 million in revenue, up 60% from the same period a year ago. That's above the $352 million that analysts were expecting, according to StreetAccount. The results come as shot makers like Pfizer face uncertainty over immunization policy and regulation under Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a prominent vaccine skeptic who now oversees the nation's federal health agencies. As secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, Kennedy has pursued a sweeping overhaul of different agencies, cutting staff, consolidating or eliminating offices and taking actions that could ultimately undermine vaccines.", "summary": null, "related_articles": [], "metadata": {"author": null, "publish_date": "2025-04-29T10:59:28+0000", "read_time": null, "keywords": "Breaking News: Earnings,Earnings,Pfizer Inc,Business,Biotechnology,Biotech and Pharmaceuticals,Pharmaceuticals,Health care industry,Breaking News: Business,Dividends,United States,Albert Bourla,Donald J.

Patients flocked to those compounded versions while Wegovy was in shortage due to skyrocketing demand.  \"We felt it was really important to work hard to establish a collaboration with telehealth companies so that there could be access to Wegovy as the compounding is winding down,\" Dave Moore, executive vice president of U.S. operations at Novo Nordisk, told CNBC.  \"We're really pleased about the level of interest to access branded Wegovy and to start to sort of catch people as they come off of compounded medicine,\" he said.  Moore added that the new partnerships make the experience \"seamless\" for patients since it allows them to access Wegovy straight from their telehealth providers, which \"makes it very easy\" for them to get the drug shipped directly to their homes.  Patients will be able to access Novo Nordisk's new direct-to-consumer online pharmacy,  , directly through the   providers.  That pharmacy offers Wegovy for $499 in cash per month – roughly half its usual monthly list price  – for patients without insurance coverage for the weekly injection.  Each telehealth company's price may be higher because they likely include additional services, a Novo Nordisk spokesperson told CNBC.  Hims & Hers said it will begin offering all dose sizes of Wegovy along with access to 24/7 care, nutritional guidance and ongoing clinical support this week, starting at $599 per month to eligible cash-paying patients with a prescription.  The medication will cost Hims & Hers customers more since it comes with added access to care, the company's CEO, Andrew Dudum, told CNBC in an interview. He said he thinks the company's partnership with Novo Nordisk will serve as a case study for how patients get access to and get prices for \"great medicine\" and other forms of treatment.  Ro opted for the lower price, announcing Tuesday it will offer access to all doses of Wegovy for $499 per month. The company provides 24/7 messaging, one-on-one coaching, educational content and more through its monthly membership called the Body Program, which does not include the cost of medication. \"Adding Novo Nordisk's FDA-approved treatments at the best available cash price will help more patients nationwide get the obesity care they need to achieve their goals, particularly those without insurance coverage,\" Ro CEO Zach Reitano said in a release. Earlier this month, Hims & Hers   that patients could access  's weight loss medication   and diabetes drug  , as well as the generic injection liraglutide, through its platform. But unlike the company's collaboration with Novo Nordisk,   released a statement clarifying that it has \"no affiliation\" with Hims & Hers. Hims & Hers started prescribing compounded semaglutide, the active ingredient in  's diabetes drug Ozempic and Wegovy, in May of 2024. The company has largely had to stop offering the compounded medications en masse, but some consumers may still be able to access personalized doses if it's clinically applicable, Dudum said.  \"That was one of the first things we shared with Novo is that we will always fight on behalf of what consumers we believe have the right to get,\" Dudum said. \"The regulation is very clear.\"  During  , pharmacists can legally make compounded versions of brand-name medications. They can also be produced on a case-by-case basis when it's medically necessary for a patient, such as when they can't swallow a pill or are allergic to a specific ingredient in a branded drug.  But drugmakers and some health experts have pushed back against the practice, largely because the FDA does not approve compounded drugs.  Larger, federally regulated compounding pharmacies that make copies of semaglutide in bulk without prescriptions face a legal deadline of May 22 to stop marketing and selling those versions. Smaller, state-licensed compounding pharmacies that manufacture semaglutide copycats for individual prescriptions had a deadline of April 22.   \"The spirit of this is that we stay true to what the rules are,\" Moore said. \"That's the best way for us to serve patients.\"", "summary": null, "related_articles": [], "metadata": {"author": null, "publish_date": "2025-04-29T11:52:16+0000", "read_time": null, "keywords": "Breaking News: Business,Health care industry,Pharmaceuticals,Biotech and Pharmaceuticals,Biotechnology,Business,Novo Nordisk A/S,Hims & Hers Health Inc,Novo Nordisk A/S,business news"}, "category": "Health and Science"}

Twenty-five years later, the company is still serving women, \"a lot of women,\" Strober says. She was a pregnant venture investor at the time she made the BabyCenter investment, and it helped to spark a bigger idea: for too long, she says, the storyline for women facing challenges has been \"just deal with it.\" \"It's a weird thing ... and that's just really unhealthy, and we have to change that,\" Strober said at the recent CNBC Changemakers Summit in Los Angeles. For Chelsea Hirschhorn, having her first child led her to become \"totally disillusioned\" with the chasm between the image of new parenthood that was marketed and the reality she experienced. \"The picture-perfect image of parenting was overwhelming for a new parent,\" she said. \"There was a big dichotomy between the content I was consuming and the front-line experience at 3 a.m.\" Hirschhorn says there was no data available at the time to substantiate what she felt because the topic was understudied and underfunded, so she \"took on\" the category of infant health and wellness. \"For whatever reason,\" Hirschhorn says, she had \"the conviction to think I could fix this.\" While there is a distinction between the health challenges the two female CEO and founders focus on — not every woman will become pregnant but all will go through menopause — one big idea binds the two women leaders together: products, treatments and services exist that can meet critical needs in an underserved, and undervalued, market. \"We have this idea that perimenopause is at a certain time and people think they have to suffer for a really long time before they get the right care, but what we say is you don't have to suffer at all,\" Strober shared at the Changemakers Summit. \"As soon as you're in your 30s and anything starts feeling wrong, you should get help. The idea of suffering is really outdated,\" she said. \"Women have been trained to suffer for far too long.\"  and   were both named to the  . (Actress and entrepreneur  , who has become a leading advocate for menopause health as founder and chief creative officer at Stripes Beauty after struggling with early menopause at the height of her early Hollywood fame, was also among the 2025 Changemakers.) At the Changemakers Summit on April 8, the two women CEOs shared advice and lessons from their successes bringing new business ideas to health care. Here are a few of the key themes they touched on in a discussion with CNBC's Kate Rooney. In addition to \"the dearth of information\" that exists to prepare women for the reality of parenthood, educational content for women has been censored when on topics related to reproductive health. That was something that Hirschhorn learned once she started Frida, a time when it was \"almost impossible,\" she says, to find authentic storytelling on the subject matter, and led her to create  . \"Sixty percent of women's health ads content, or content in general, has been in some way, shape or form, rejected or filtered,\" she said. That's not just online but on linear television, part of what Hirschhorn calls a \"very gendered dichotomy,\" citing the fact that male health and sexual wellness content is approved at a significantly higher rate. That leaves her \"incredulous,\" she said, and it is a call to action to shift from women's health being a topic of provocation to a topic of public health. \"Women have to advocate for themselves,\" she said. \"Women can't be complacent, and this goes beyond health care. This can drive real change, in retail ... in every facet of life,\" she added. Strober noted that when she was building Midi Health it became clear that a major challenge would be working with codes created by the insurance industry for menopause, in effect, another form of institutional censorship. Midi Health decided to position itself as an in-network primary care provider that had a specialty in menopause and that turned out to be a \"really effective\" way to gain traction, she says, and it now has nationwide insurance coverage with all the large insurance companies in the U.S. \"They are not necessarily going to cover sexual health issues but they will cover primary care, so you just subsume it,\" she explained. By viewing menopause as just part of women's health, she says, the company was able to create a reimbursement mechanism that meets insurance standards. That insurance coverage is a very big deal, because research is showing that lack of menopause treatment can have a high cost when it comes to women's careers.   Strober pointed to during the Changemakers discussion found that at the mid-career moment when women should be gaining their greatest successes in the workplace, the shift into menopause can hold them back. Strober said the growing body of research details how menopause can result in discrimination at work, with women quitting jobs, or not going for raises or promotions because of symptoms, and also because they don't believe they can get the treatment that they need. \"If you believe that you have something that can't be fixed, it's very embarrassing, and that means people step back from what they are doing,\" Strober said. \"They are scared,\" she added. That can be the experience that is called brain fog, and also hot flashes. \"You lose power during hot flashes,\" Strober said. \"People are not as confident. But if you are getting treated for it, 'it's just a hot flash' and you can regain power,\" she added. Hirschhorn says that by the numbers, there is still huge potential in the women's health market. It is estimated to grow to $60 billion by 2027, according to data she cited at the event, and that is despite the fact that less than 4% of health-care R&D spending and investment goes to the category — a \"seismic gap,\" she said. It is a well-known fact in consumer research that women dominate household spending, but Hirschhorn said in Frida's market there is a \"viral\" opportunity that is underappreciated. \"Creating products for women based on real need creates a virality that is hard to recreate with other demographics,\" she said. \"These women aren't just buying their products, they are selling them to their communities and friends. We call that 'word of mom,\" Hirschhorn said. \"It's a really big untapped opportunity,\" she added. As a former venture investor, Strober said it is important to accept that \"people are not dying to invest in women's health,\" but she added that when you can show the growth that companies like Midi Health are posting, that won't slow a company down. \"We are the fastest-growing digital health company, probably ever, quite honestly,\" she said. \"We are growing insanely fast because women really need access to this care and can't get it elsewhere,\" she added. Similar to the \"virality\" experienced by Frida, Strober says the business model does build on itself. \"Once you take care of one thing for women they come back to you for something else, and if you develop this trusted platform for them, where they become your long-term patient, that is a good business,\" she said. \"We don't say it's a women's business, we say it's a really good business,\" she added. That opportunity and the unfiltered realities of parenthood have now grown Frida to more than 150 products, covering everything from conception to post-partum and breastfeeding care, and beyond. \"My four children are a hotbed of inspiration and my 'snot sucking' days are almost over,\" Hirschhorn said. But she added, \"The same problems exist, you just need a different toolkit.\" At Midi Health, Strober says the next big opportunity to unlock is making connections between menopause health and longevity. \"If you take care of yourself in your 40s you can really prevent a lot of the diseases that come in your 80s, and so we have been thinking a lot about this longevity market,\" Strober said. \"It's all bros, all the bros who are out there and talking about wanting to live to 150. We just want to take care of ourselves. We don't care about living to 150. We just want to be healthy grandmas,\" she said. \"What do we do, how do we take care of our brains and bones and hearts to age in a healthy way?\" Strober asks. She says there are many treatments, products and services yet to be developed by health companies that will help women in their 40s, 50s and 60s to better answer that question.", "summary": null, "related_articles": [], "metadata": {"author": null, "publish_date": "2025-04-29T19:23:50+0000", "read_time": null, "keywords": "Menopause,Health,Gender issues,Health care industry,Health insurance,Suppress Zephr,Social issues,business news"}, "category": "Health and Science"}

For many, the big question is whether the pricey medications known as GLP-1s will pay off by improving worker health and lowering overall health costs over time. Analysts at Aon say it's already happening.   \"We've never seen anything like this, really,\" said Greg Case, CEO of  , an employer benefits services firm. \"There was a 44% reduction in major cardiovascular issues. There was substantial reduction in osteoporosis. There was substantial reduction in pneumonia of multiple types.\" Aon researchers found that within two years, patients taking GLP-1 drugs saw improved health outcomes, which significantly slowed the growth rate of their medical costs. The rate of growth, known as the medical cost trend – was cut roughly in half, the researchers said.     GLP-1s come at a list price of more than $1,000 per dose. As broader approval for the drugs spurs higher demand, it's also causing employer drug spending to spike. Since 2023, GLP-1s have pushed costs up at a faster pace than high-priced specialty medications, which include costly cancer and autoimmune treatments,   by Evernorth, a division of  . Aon analysts looked at medical claims data for 139,000 U.S.-based workers with employer health coverage who took GLP-1 medications between 2022 and 2024. Beyond the drug costs, the study found GLP-1 patients tend to incur higher medical costs in their first year on the drugs, with more doctor visits to monitor their treatment on the drug and to seek help for other issues such as sleep apnea and esophageal conditions like acid reflux. \"The increase comes about in the first 12 to 15 months,\" Case said. \"They're getting remedies on things that actually are underlying conditions [of obesity].\" But by the end of the second year of treatment with the GLP-1 drugs, the medical cost trend for patients taking them slowed by 7% on average, compared to workers with similar chronic conditions and obesity characteristics who were not taking the drugs, Aon found. For those not taking the drug, the medical cost trend was 14%. The biggest driver of those savings was the reduction by more than 40% of major adverse cardiac events such as heart attacks and strokes, compared with patients who were not taking the drugs, as well as a reduction in the onset of diabetes.  Case said with this data, Aon has been able to help clients understand the timeline for seeing a return on providing insurance coverage for GLP-1s for weight loss, in addition to Type 2 diabetes. \"We saw every single place where the cost went down — and it's stunning,\" said Case. \"You can do this in a way that has an ROI, that will literally be an economic return.\" Following its research, Aon has launched a subsidized GLP-1 weight management program for its own U.S. workforce, which includes weekly virtual wellness visits and home blood tests to help employees adhere to the drug regimen.

Kennedy Jr.'s   of the Department of Health and Human Services involves deep cuts to several divisions that help protect and improve the health of minority and underserved populations and eliminate health disparities in the U.S., CNBC has learned. Kennedy, the Health and Human Services secretary, has gutted at least seven minority health offices across the department, according to people familiar with the matter, who requested anonymity to speak freely. HHS has laid off a significant share of workers at those offices, or in some cases all of them, along with their directors, the people said. The affected units include the HHS Office of Minority Health and the National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities, or  . The cuts also hit offices with similar functions at the Food and Drug Administration, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, the Health Resources and Services Administration, and the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, according to the people.  Health policy experts told CNBC that deep cuts to those divisions could widen existing health disparities in the U.S., undoing years of progress toward addressing them. Over time, that could worsen health outcomes for already underserved groups, threaten overall public health, strain the U.S. health-care system and drive up health-care costs.  \"It will have negative health impacts, obviously, for groups that they're focused on, so racial and ethnic minorities, but I think what gets missed in the story is it ultimately impacts all of us, no matter what your background is,\" Dr. Stephanie Ettinger De Cuba, research professor of health law, policy and management at Boston University, told CNBC.  \"It's not a zero-sum game. So I think that's what is deeply disturbing to me, as we are going to see people get hurt,\" she said. \"Decimating or cutting staff from these offices ultimately makes it worse for everyone.\" The Trump administration can't shutter the affected offices entirely, which would   since they were authorized by the Affordable Care Act more than a decade ago, the people said. The exact fate of each office and the NIH institute is unclear, they added.  The administration likely hopes to at least \"narrow the scope\" of what NIMHD and the agency offices do, curtailing their authority and limiting resources, said Brandyn Churchill, professor of public administration and policy at American University.  The cuts come as health disparities remain a major challenge in the U.S., affecting not only people of color but also rural residents, low-income communities and individuals with disabilities, among several other groups. These communities often face worse health outcomes – such as lower life expectancy and higher rates of infant mortality and chronic disease – and more limited access to care and other resources than the U.S. population as a whole.  The Covid-19 pandemic deepened many of these gaps, highlighting how the long U.S. history of exclusionary policies and systemic issues such as poverty and racism contribute to unequal health outcomes across the country.  Health policy experts stress that addressing those disparities leads to stronger overall public health, as healthier communities improve outcomes for everyone. It could also relieve a huge economic burden on the U.S: a   found that racial and ethnic health disparities cost the U.S. economy $451 billion in 2018.   Kennedy is consolidating divisions and slashing 10,000 jobs at HHS,   that oversees vaccines and other medicines, scientific research, public health infrastructure, pandemic preparedness, and food and tobacco products. HHS also manages government-funded health care for millions of Americans – including seniors, disabled people and lower-income patients who rely on Medicare, Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act's markets. Kennedy plans to create a new HHS agency called the Administration for a Healthy America, which will combine several existing offices. That includes HRSA, SAMHSA, the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Health, the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry, and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health. A leaked 64-page preliminary budget document also indicates that the HHS Office of Minority Health would fall under that new agency, according to several reports. But that proposal, which would slash the HHS budget by a third, or roughly $40 billion, requires congressional approval.  HHS did not immediately respond to a request for comment. While the breadth of the cutbacks varied at agencies within HHS, the minority health agencies across the departments will now be only a fraction of their former size. All 40 staff members at the CMS Office of Minority Health were laid off, according to the people. CMS plans to appoint a new director for that unit, but the current director has not resigned from the role, CNBC previously  .  The office works with local and federal partners to eliminate disparities in health coverage, aiming to ensure that minority and underserved populations can access Medicare, Medicaid and Affordable Care Act marketplace plans. It also conducts research and analysis to help lower costs and reduce the incidence and severity of chronic diseases in the U.S.  Nearly all staff at the CDC's Office of Minority Health were cut, according to the people. To adhere to the letter of the law, the Trump administration is considering reconstituting that unit and the Office of Women's Health so that each office would be made up of at least one director or a very small group of employees, the people said.  The agency's Office of Minority Health works across CDC to promote research of health disparities and create programs to improve the health of racial and ethnic minority groups. At the FDA's Office of Minority Health and Health Equity, all staff were cut, the people said. The future of that office is unclear.  The unit focuses on efforts such as increasing clinical trial diversity, improving transparency around how medical products affect different populations, and creating health resources tailored to a range of languages and cultures. No staff are left at HRSA's Office of Health Equity after the layoffs, as well as some retirements and reassignments, according to the people. That office leads efforts to reduce disparities in health-care access, quality and outcomes through HRSA, which focuses on people who are uninsured, geographically isolated, or economically and medically vulnerable. The future of that office is also unclear, apart from the Trump administration's plans to fold HRSA into Kennedy's new agency. The same goes for SAMHSA's , which saw all remaining staff cut except for a new, recently hired director, according to the people. The office also had a retirement and one worker on probation who was put on administrative leave.  The office works to ensure that SAMHSA's resources for mental health and substance abuse treatment, including grant programs and other initiatives, are equitably distributed across all communities and populations. Roughly a third of staff are gone at NIMHD, some of whom were laid off and others who left due to early retirements and buyouts, the people said. Some workers on probation were put on leave several weeks before Kennedy started cuts, they said.  The institute's deputy director accepted an offer to be acting director in the short term, the people added. NIMHD, which is part of the National Institutes of Health, works to reduce health disparities through conducting and funding research and developing new programs. The HHS Office of Minority Health also faced cuts, though it's unclear how many staff were impacted, the people said. That office leads the federal effort to improve health outcomes for racial and ethnic minority groups, developing policies and programs and providing funding. It will likely take several months to a year before the U.S. sees direct consequences from the cuts to NIMHD and the offices, said Terry McGovern, professor at the CUNY Graduate School of Public Health and Health Policy. But the staff reductions could cause the U.S. to lose out on crucial data, which is the cornerstone for addressing health disparities, according to Samantha Artiga, director for the racial equity and health policy program at KFF, a health policy research organization.  Artiga said data and research are essential for pinpointing where disparities exist, understanding their root causes, crafting effective solutions, and tracking progress over time. For example, data can reveal whether certain groups experience worse surgical outcomes or wait longer at the emergency room, or if a vaccination program is being equitably distributed across regions. \"Without focused data and research, those disparities may remain unseen and unaddressed, creating blind spots,\" Artiga said, adding that the U.S. would eventually have to rebuild that knowledge in the future.  The fate of many of the grants that NIMHD and some of the offices provide is unclear. That includes  from HHS' Office of Minority Health to 20 organizations for a four-year initiative to identify strategies that increase the use of preventive health services in communities.  But if offices cut back that funding or stop it altogether, it could also weaken the nation's ability to reduce health disparities, Boston University's Ettinger De Cuba said.  Community-based organizations rely on federal money to deliver culturally tailored care to different groups, and could be forced to scale back or shut down programs. The loss of grants could also stall research, innovation and public health interventions by outside entities, such as universities, health-care systems and social service organizations.  \"Philanthropy is not able to step up at this level long term. The only actor that's able to do that is the government,\" Ettinger De Cuba said.  Nathan Boucher, research professor at Duke's Sanford School of Public Policy, added that the cuts will \"degrade any effort of these larger governmental organizations to have any accountability when it comes to protecting the people they help and serve every day.\"  While Kennedy has said his cuts are focused on making HHS more \"responsive and efficient,\" Boucher said targeting minority health offices could do the opposite.  \"I actually think it's an efficiency argument to be able to have these minority health offices, because it allows you to identify and target some real problem areas and use taxpayer dollars in the most efficient way possible,\" said Boucher. ", "summary": null, "related_articles": [], "metadata": {"author": null, "publish_date": "2025-04-30T16:42:17+0000", "read_time": null, "keywords": "Breaking News: Politics,Business,Biotechnology,Biotech and Pharmaceuticals,Pharmaceuticals,Health care industry,Breaking News: Business,Politics,business news"}, "category": "Health and Science"}

The unit's medical benefit ratio — a measure of total medical expenses paid relative to premiums collected — decreased to 87.3% from 90.4% a year earlier. A lower ratio typically indicates that a company collected more in premiums than it paid out in benefits, resulting in higher profitability. CVS said the move partly reflects stronger underlying performance in its Medicare business and improved Medicare Advantage star ratings for the 2025 payment year. Those ratings help patients compare the quality of Medicare health and drug plans. \"I think that investment and talent that allowed us to focus on both the execution and the operation … actually helped establish the performance that you're seeing,\" Joyner said, referring to an executive reshuffling last year that tapped a new leader for the insurance unit and other parts of the business. The results cap off the second full quarter with  , a longtime CVS executive, as chief executive of the retail drugstore chain. Joyner succeeded Karen Lynch in mid-October, as CVS struggled to drive higher profits and improve its stock performance. The company underwent a management reshuffle as part of a broader turnaround plan that includes   in cost cuts over the next several years. Still, CVS' performance was partially offset by a charge of $431 million from so-called premium deficiency reserves in the insurance unit, which is related to anticipated losses in the 2025 coverage year. That refers to a liability that an insurer may need to cover if future premiums are not enough to pay for anticipated claims and expenses. The company posted net income of $1.78 billion, or $1.41 per share, for the first quarter. That compares with net income of $1.12 billion, or 88 cents per share, for the year-earlier period.  Excluding certain items, such as amortization of intangible assets, restructuring charges and capital losses, adjusted earnings were $2.25 per share for the quarter. CVS booked sales of $94.59 billion for the first quarter, up 7% from the same period a year ago due to growth across all three of its business segments.  But sales in the company's retail pharmacy segment missed Wall Street's expectations for the quarter, according to StreetAccount. That business has been pressured by softer consumer spending and lower reimbursements for prescription drugs.  CVS' insurance business booked $34.81 billion in revenue during the quarter, up 8% from the first quarter of 2024. Analysts expected the unit to take in $33.51 billion for the period, according to estimates from StreetAccount. The unit also recorded adjusted operating income of $1.99 billion for the first quarter, compared with $732 million for the year-earlier period.  Also on Thursday, CVS said Aetna will stop offering health insurance plans on the Affordable Care Act marketplaces — also known as individual exchanges — starting in the 2026 plan year. CVS' pharmacy and consumer wellness division booked $31.91 billion in sales for the first quarter, up more than 11% from the same period a year earlier. But that was far under the $35.27 billion that analysts were expecting for the quarter, according to StreetAccount. That unit dispenses prescriptions in CVS' more than 9,000 retail pharmacies and provides other pharmacy services, such as vaccinations and diagnostic testing. CVS' health services segment generated $43.46 billion in revenue for the quarter, up nearly 8% compared with the same quarter in 2024. Analysts expected the unit to post $43.64 billion in sales for the period, according to StreetAccount. That unit includes Caremark, one of the nation's largest pharmacy benefit managers.

The move is part of a new partnership between Caremark and Wegovy's manufacturer,  , according to CVS'   release. Caremark will also drop the weight loss drug Zepbound from its standard formularies on that date, in a blow to its manufacturer,  , a CVS spokesperson told CNBC. They said those standard formularies are the most common among Caremark's client base, representing tens of millions of patients. Eligible patients covered by Caremark who are currently taking Zepbound will be able to switch to Wegovy, the spokesperson said. Shares of Novo Nordisk closed around 1% lower on Thursday, while Eli Lilly's stock closed more than 11% lower.  It comes as Novo Nordisk works to boost access to Wegovy now that it is no longer in   in the U.S. Partnering with Caremark, one of the nation's largest pharmacy benefit managers, could help the drugmaker reach even more patients. Caremark discounts drugs with manufacturers on behalf of insurance plans and creates lists of medications, or formularies, that are covered by insurance and reimburses pharmacies for prescriptions. Caremark will make the drug available to its members at \"a more affordable price.\" The PBM negotiated a lower net price for Wegovy over Zepbound on its standard formularies, offering savings to clients that opt into those plans, the CVS spokesperson said. But Caremark's clients, which are employers and unions, \"individually determine how much of that savings on Wegovy gets shared with its members either via lower premiums or lower copays at the pharmacy counter,\" the spokesperson said.  Separately, any patient who does not have insurance coverage for Wegovy or another GLP-1 can still buy Novo Nordisk's drug out-of-pocket for $499 at any of CVS' 9,000 pharmacies nationwide, the spokesperson added.  In its earnings release, CVS said it is the first retail pharmacy partnering with Novo Nordisk's new direct-to-consumer online pharmacy,  , to dispense Wegovy to patients with prescriptions. NovoCare offers Wegovy at that lower price point to cash-paying patients, who may struggle to shoulder the drug's roughly $1,000 list price before insurance and other rebates. Caremark will also combine Wegovy with additional lifestyle support, such as personalized nutrition plans, as part of the CVS Weight Management program. The announcement comes as the Danish drugmaker races to capture more patients now that many compounding pharmacies are legally restricted from making cheaper, unapproved versions of Wegovy, with rare exceptions. \"It's unknown at this point how the migration from the compound pharmacies into other pharmacy settings are going to occur,\" CVS Health group president Prem Shah said on an earnings call on Thursday. \"But we do expect that there will be obviously some benefit by opening up 9,000 stores, or 9,000 opportunities for patients to be able to get the medication.\" Dave Moore, Novo Nordisk's executive vice president of U.S. operations, said in a separate release on Thursday that \"it is our responsibility to continue to work with others across the US healthcare system to find innovative opportunities to meet the needs of these patients and connect them with authentic, FDA-approved Wegovy … in a convenient and affordable way.\"", "summary": null, "related_articles": [], "metadata": {"author": null, "publish_date": "2025-05-01T10:31:30+0000", "read_time": null, "keywords": "Breaking News: Business,Health care industry,Pharmaceuticals,Biotech and Pharmaceuticals,Biotechnology,Business,CVS Health Corp,Novo Nordisk A/S,Novo Nordisk A/S,LILLY DRN,business news"}, "category": "Health and Science"}

The pharmaceutical giant now expects its adjusted fiscal 2025 earnings to come in between $20.78 and $22.28 per share, down from previous guidance of $22.50 to $24 per share. Eli Lilly said the revision reflects a $1.57 billion deal charge recorded in the first quarter, which is primarily related to its acquisition of a certain oral cancer drug from Scorpion Therapeutics. The company maintained its fiscal 2025 sales guidance of $58 billion to $61 billion. Eli Lilly said the guidance reflects President  's existing tariffs as of May 1, but does not include his planned levies on pharmaceuticals imported into the U.S. In an interview with CNBC, Eli Lilly CEO Dave Ricks said the company and other drugmakers are already announcing  , which is one of the Trump administration's stated goals of the tariffs. \"I think that actually the threat of tariffs is already bringing back critical supply chains into important industries, chips and pharma,\" Ricks said. \"So do we need to enact [tariffs?] I'm not so sure.\" He added that Eli Lilly wants to see permanently lower tax rates in the U.S., particularly 15% for domestic production. Ricks said lower taxes drove many drugmakers to manufacture in \"low-tax islands like Ireland Singapore and in Switzerland, and that can come back if there's an economic incentive.\" Eli Lilly's blockbuster diabetes treatment Mounjaro topped expectations for the first quarter, raking in $3.84 billion in revenue. That's up a whopping 113% from the same period a year ago. The company's weight loss drug Zepbound also beat estimates, booking $2.31 billion in sales for the quarter. That more than quadrupled the $517.4 million that the treatment brought in a year ago, when it had just entered the U.S. market. Analysts expected Mounjaro and Zepbound to generate $3.81 billion and $2.28 billion in sales, respectively, according to estimates from StreetAccount. Shares of Eli Lilly closed more than 11% on Thursday. That came after   on Thursday said its pharmacy benefit manager would make   Wegovy the preferred weight loss medication on its main formularies instead of Zepbound. Here's what Eli Lilly reported for the first quarter compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:  The company posted first-quarter revenue of $12.73 billion, up 45% from the same period a year ago.  Sales in the U.S. jumped 49% to $8.49 billion. Eli Lilly said that was driven by a 57% increase in volume – or the number of prescriptions or units sold – for Zepbound and Mounjaro. That was partially offset by lower realized prices of the drugs, the company said. The pharmaceutical giant booked net income of $2.76 billion, or $3.06 per share, for the first quarter. That compares with net income of $2.24 billion, or $2.48 share, a year earlier.  Excluding one-time items associated with the value of intangible assets and other adjustments, Eli Lilly posted earnings of $3.34 per share for the first quarter. Demand in the U.S. has still far outpaced supply of Zepbound and Mounjaro over the last year. Both so-called incretin treatments mimic certain gut hormones to tamp down a person's appetite and regulate their blood sugar. The popularity of those injectable drugs has forced both Eli Lilly and its rival   to invest billions to ramp up manufacturing capacity for their treatments. The efforts appear to be paying off: The Food and Drug Administration in December   to declare the U.S. shortage of tirzepatide — the active ingredient in Zepbound and Mounjaro — over.

He spoke after Eli Lilly  , which did not include estimated effects of the potential pharmaceutical tariffs. He said national security concerns around those medications are \"valid.\" But he added: \"Do I think tariffs are the answer to that? I'm not so sure personally.\" \"We would be happy to talk to this administration or national security people about how we could respond to such a crisis,\" he said. \"We have capacities to bring to bear there, and we're happy to help the country if we're in need.\" Older generic drugs account for about  prescribed in the U.S. Many are critical for hospital care, including antibiotics and vasopressors, or medications that raise blood pressure.  Ricks noted that those essential drugs are \"not easy to make, but they're cheap, and they've been driven out of our country due to cost and other damaging policies.\" However, some health experts previously told CNBC that tariffs on generic drugs, which have far lower profit margins than branded medications, could force some generic drugmakers to leave the U.S. market altogether. That could lead to or exacerbate shortages of certain generic drugs in the U.S., such as sterile injectable drugs commonly used in hospitals. Rick's comments come as drugmakers brace for President  's planned pharmaceutical tariffs, which aim to boost domestic manufacturing. Those tariff threats are already   of U.S. manufacturing investments from the pharmaceutical industry.

References to the insect were abundant at the company's old headquarters in London, where a picture of a cockroach was prominently displayed on the wall. For much of Hinge's 10-year history, the cockroach was the unofficial mascot. Staffers named it Flossy after the viral dance move \"the floss.\" Perez relishes the symbolism. In his determination to build a company that will push through adversity, he's encouraged employees to think of themselves like cockroaches, due to the creature's grimy resilience and noted ability to survive harsh conditions. \"It was the identity of every individual in the company,\" said Joshua Sturm, a vice president at Hinge from 2019 to 2024 and now chief revenue officer at cancer prevention startup Color Health. \"We are all in this together, and no matter what happens, we are going to survive together.\" Perez and his 1,400-person workforce now face the ultimate test of their mettle. Hinge, which moved from London to San Francisco in 2017, is trying to go public at a time of such extreme economic uncertainty and market volatility that several companies, including online lender   and ticket marketplace  , have delayed their long-awaited IPOs. Hinge filed its prospectus  , announcing plans to trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol \"HNGE.\" Three weeks later,   announced a sweeping tariff policy that plunged U.S. markets into turmoil after tariff concerns had already pushed the Nasdaq to its worst quarter since 2022. But Hinge, led by its 39-year-old co-founder and CEO, appears determined to power through the chaos. Hinge declined to comment or make Perez available for an interview.  Going public was already going to be a risky endeavor for Hinge. The IPO market has been   since late 2021, when soaring inflation and rising interest rates pushed investors out of risky assets. Within digital health, it's been almost completely dead. Health-tech companies have struggled to adapt to a more muted growth environment following the Covid pandemic, and many once promising business models haven't panned out as planned. The starkest example is virtual health company  , which has a market cap of just over $1 billion less than five years after buying digital health provider Livongo in a deal that valued the   at $37 billion. Teladoc's BetterHelp mental health unit has been a particularly troublesome business as paying users dropped off in the years following the pandemic. Over time, Hinge's Cockroach Award transitioned from a monthly prize to a quarterly distinction. The company phased it out entirely about a year ago in preparation for its next public-facing chapter, but the survive-at-all-costs mentality persists, according to current employees. Now, staffers are recognized with the \"Movers Awards,\" a nod to the company's focus on movement. \"We have many decades of work ahead,\" Perez wrote in a letter to investors in March. \"We hope you join us on this journey.\" CNBC spoke to 13 current and former Hinge employees, investors, and people close to Perez for this story, some of whom asked not to be named in order to provide candid commentary. Hinge uses software to help patients treat acute musculoskeletal injuries, chronic pain and carry out post-surgery rehabilitation remotely. Large employers like   and   cover the costs so their employees can access Hinge's app-based virtual physical therapy, as well as its wearable electrical nerve stimulation device called Enso.  The company   its technology can help users manage pain, cut down health-care costs and reduce the need for surgery and opioids. Revenue increased 33% to $390.4 million last year, while its net loss narrowed to $11.9 million from $108.1 million a year earlier, according to the prospectus. Hinge's roster of clients expanded by 36% last year to 2,256, and the number of individual members jumped 44% to over 532,300, the filing said. In an   on Monday, Hinge   revenue in its first quarter climbed 50% to $123.8 million, up from $82.7 million during the same period last year, and that net income for the period was $17.1 million compared to a loss of $26.5 million a year ago.  Hinge has raised more than $1 billion from investors including Tiger Global Management and Coatue Management, and it boasted a   as of October 2021, the last time the company raised outside funding. The biggest institutional shareholders are venture firms Insight Partners and Atomico, which own 19% and 15% of the stock, respectively, according to the filing. Perez and Gabriel Mecklenburg, Hinge's executive chairman, started the company in 2014. The pair met while they were both pursuing PhDs in the U.K. — Perez at the University of Oxford and Mecklenburg at Imperial College London. They were distracted students, according to Perez's twin brother, David.  By the time they launched Hinge, Perez and Mecklenburg had already co-founded two other ventures together. One was the Oxbridge Biotech Roundtable, an organization that connected academics and industry experts. The other was Marblar, which worked to commercialize academic intellectual property. Perez took a leave of absence from Oxford while working on Marblar and never returned. His brother wasn't a fan of the decision initially. \"I gave him terrible advice,\" said David Perez, a graduate of Yale Law School and partner at Perkins Coie in Seattle. \"I was like, 'I think you're an idiot, I think you should focus on your PhD. Only an idiot would not finish a PhD at Oxford.'\"  The twins have two older siblings. Their mother immigrated from Cuba in 1968, followed 12 years later by their father. Their parents met in Miami, got married after just three dates, and are still together after more than 40 years.  The family moved from Miami to Salt Lake City, Utah, in 1990. Perez's mother was a substitute teacher and his father worked at restaurants as a dishwasher and busboy. David Perez said their father \"worked around the clock\" and used to call out orders in his sleep.  \"It wasn't a lot of money, I think combined they made about $19,000 a year,\" David Perez said. \"But they stitched it together and raised four kids.\"  The twin boys were competitive, particularly when it came to academics and playing basketball in the driveway. David said his brother got \"great grades\" and always had an inclination toward science and medicine, graduating from high school at age 16 and then starting college at Westminster University, a small liberal arts school in Utah. \"I swear,\" David Perez said, \"there were times where the only punishment that my mom could issue that would have the sting was restricting our ability to do homework.\" Perez was a student in the Honors College at Westminster, and he graduated with a degree in biology. Richard Badenhausen, dean of the Honors College, described Perez as an independent thinker and an ambitious student, especially for his age.  \"He didn't care too much what people thought about him, which is a strength in my book,\" Badenhausen said in an interview.  When Perez was 13, he was hit by a car. He broke an arm and a leg, and had to be airlifted to a nearby hospital. After three surgeries and 12 months of rehab, he had a newfound interest in orthopedics and physical therapy.  Mecklenburg had a serious injury of his own, tearing his anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) during a judo match, which also required a year of rehab, according to Hinge's website. One day in October 2014  the pair put their heads together and outlined the tools they wished were available while undergoing physical therapy. Musculoskeletal conditions affect as many as 1.7 billion people worldwide, according to Hinge's prospectus, so there was no shortage of opportunities. They had the early concept of Hinge within hours and a prototype ready by December of that year. In Hinge's early days, Perez and Mecklenburg would meet every Saturday morning to talk shop. Now, as they've aged and started families, they meet on Wednesday nights, according to colleagues. Perez welcomed his first child with his wife late last year.  \"Seeing the growth over the last six, seven, eight years has just been unbelievable,\" said Jon Reynolds, a tech founder who contributed to Hinge's seed funding round. \"That comes down to the quality of Dan and Gabriel as leaders. They complement each other really well, and they've obviously got that mutual respect.\" Perez is a hands-on CEO who expects a lot from his staff.  He's direct, detail-oriented, opinionated, competitive and can be intense, according to current and former employees. But he's committed to the mission and the wellbeing of his employees, they said. \"He's one of those rare founder CEOs who I think can go all the way,\" said Paul Kruszewski, a former Hinge employee who joined the company after it acquired his Canadian computer vision startup, Wrnch, in 2021.  Employees say Perez is a voracious reader, often finishing two to four books a month. That includes books about business and leadership, an important source of information given that Hinge was his first real job. He's a fan of \"The Innovator's Prescription,\" by   and others, \"Crossing the Chasm,\" by Geoffrey Moore and \"The Long Fix,\" by Dr. Vivian Lee. He also likes his staffers to read. Executives will often prepare to discuss chapters from a book in their meetings.  \"I'd come home and there'd be a package from Dan, and it's a book,\" said Sturm, who led partnerships and new market development at Hinge. \"That was just the norm.\" Sturm, who has worked in the health-care and benefits space for around 30 years, said Hinge was very deliberate with hiring, so there wasn't a lot of turnover among senior executives. He said Hinge's recruitment process was the hardest he's ever experienced.  Another \"Dan-ism,\" as Sturm called it, is Hinge's philosophy around writing. Perez has employees write memos, typically up to six pages long, instead of preparing slide decks or other materials ahead of meetings. Perez was inspired by a similar practice at  , according to current and former employees, and sees it as a way to force employees to think through what they want to say instead of hiding behind bullet points. Hinge's memo culture can be an adjustment, particularly for new employees. Sturm said he thought the practice was \"insane\" at first, but ultimately came to appreciate it and said it improved his pitches. \"When you sort of sit back, you go, 'You know actually, he wasn't wrong,'\" Sturm said.  Hinge has come a long way since venture firm Atomico led the $8 million Series A investment in 2017. The London-based firm said in a   at the time that it was \"extremely impressed by Daniel and Gabriel, and their determination to tackle a big problem in society.\" Carolina Brochado led the round, though she left Atomico a year later and now works at investment firm EQT Group. She said that getting Hinge to the brink of an IPO was a \"one in a million chance,\" but noted that the company has managed to build a sizable business in digital health despite having so many odds stacked against it. \"Lots of learnings along the way, of course, like a big tech correction in the middle,\" Brochado said in an interview. \"But it really is one of those rare examples of just an enormous market that was under penetrated.\" For David Perez, whose firm now serves as Hinge's outside counsel, watching the startup grow has been \"fascinating,\" he said. \"I'm a partner at a major law firm,\" he said, \"and I am only the second most successful twin. But I think I'm okay with that.\"  ", "summary": null, "related_articles": [], "metadata": {"author": null, "publish_date": "2025-05-05T12:00:01+0000", "read_time": null, "keywords": "IPO,Teladoc Health Inc,Amazon.com Inc,Breaking News: Technology,Technology,Internet,Health care industry,Venture capital,Target Corp,Morgan Stanley,Donald J.

Ezra's primary competitor is  , another full-body   startup. In February, Prenuvo announced that it closed a $120 million funding round, and it also launched a new blood test to provide insights into patients' hormonal, cardiovascular, metabolic and immune health.  Ezra has raised a total of $44 million from investors, while Function has raised a total of $53 million as of June 2024. Function is reportedly seeking more than $200 million in fresh capital at a valuation of around $2 billion, according to a February report from . Emi Gal, the founder and CEO of Ezra, said he has known Function's Swerdlin for years, and that the two began chatting last year about potentially collaborating through a commercial partnership. Over time, though, he said it became clear that an acquisition ultimately made more sense.    \"I'm pinching myself,\" Gal said in an interview. \"This is just a phenomenal outcome.\" The company was able to shorten its new scan time to 22 minutes by leveraging artificial intelligence that was cleared by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in January, Gal said. The AI, as well as Function's \"financial prowess,\" helped reduce the price of the scan to $499, he added. The new 22-minute scan will be available to Function members starting on Monday. Function does not publicly disclose how many patients subscribe to its platform, but Swerdlin said it's in the \"hundreds of thousands.\"  Dr. Mark Hyman, co-founder and the chief medical officer of Function, said acquiring Ezra was a natural part of Function's evolution.   \"What used to be the domain of the wealthy is now accessible to everybody, including comprehensive imaging,\" Hyman said in an interview. \"It truly makes a difference for people and saves lives.\"", "summary": null, "related_articles": [], "metadata": {"author": null, "publish_date": "2025-05-05T16:00:01+0000", "read_time": null, "keywords": "Health care industry,Enterprise,Internet,Technology,Breaking News: Technology,business news"}, "category": "Health and Science"}

It also directs the agency to raise inspection fees for foreign manufacturing plants, improve the enforcement of active-ingredient source reporting by overseas producers and consider publicly listing facilities that don't comply. The White House estimates that it can currently take five to 10 years to build new manufacturing capacity for pharmaceuticals, which it called \"unacceptable from a national-security standpoint.\"  \"We don't want to be buying our pharmaceuticals from other countries because if we're in a war, we're in a problem, we want to be able to make our own,\" Trump said in the fact sheet. \"As we invest in the future, we will permanently bring our medical supply chains back home. We will produce our medical supplies, pharmaceuticals, and treatments right here in the United States.\" The order will allow the FDA to conduct more inspections of new manufacturing sites with the same resources, the agency's commissioner, Marty Makary, told reporters on Monday. The FDA will also ramp up inspections of foreign drug facilities, switching from announced to \"surprise\" visits overseas, he said. \"We had this crazy system in the United States where American pharma manufacturers ... are put through the ringer with inspections, and the foreign sites get a lot easier with scheduled visits, while we have surprise visits,\" Makary said. Trump's order also directs the Environmental Protection Agency to \"accelerate the construction of facilities\" related to manufacturing drugs and their ingredients. And, it ensures that federal agencies issuing permits for a domestic pharmaceutical manufacturing facility designate a single point-of-contact to coordinate applications, along with support from the White House Office of Management and Budget.
