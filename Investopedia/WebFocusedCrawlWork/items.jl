This may come as no surprise considering that the share price rose 2.5% the day after the announcement.\n Eli Lilly reported earnings per share (EPS) of $1.87 and revenue of $6.74 billion, missing analysts' expectations calling for EPS of $1.89 while beating expectations for revenue of $6.59 billion. Prior to the announcement, investors had bid up the share price of LLY to an extreme range, with a large number of sold put options in the open interest.\n Option trading volumes indicate that traders had been buying calls and selling puts; however, option trading activity after earnings indicates that traders are still confident in LLY's share price going forward. That's because the price action has remained in an extreme range, while option activity implies that traders continue to buy calls and sell puts.\nKey TakeawaysTraders and investors bought shares of LLY following the earnings announcement, as the stock rose 2.5%.The share price of LLY continued to close above its 20-day moving average.Put and call option activity appears to be positioned for the share price to rise.The volatility-based support and resistance levels allow for a stronger move to the downside.This setup creates an opportunity for traders to profit from a reversal in the earnings-based price movement. Option trading is a literal bet on the probabilities of the market\u2014a bet made by traders that are, on average, better informed than most investors. The key to maximizing insight into option trading is to understand the context in which the price movement took place. The chart below illustrates the price action for LLY's share price as of Aug. 9, illustrating the setup after the earnings report.\n Current Trends  The one-month trend of the stock saw the share price pushing above the upper extremes of the volatility range, closing well above the 20-day moving average, closing in the highest extremes of the range depicted by the technical studies on this chart.\n These studies are formed by 20-day Keltner Channel indicators. These depict price levels that represent a multiple of the Average True Range (ATR) for the stock. This array helps to highlight the way the price has exceeded the upper bounds of the volatility range. This price movefrom LLY shares implies that investors are extremely confident in the share price of LLY going forward.\nTipThe Average True Range (ATR) has become a standard tool for depicting historical volatility over time. The typical average length of time used in its calculation is 10 to 20 time periods, which includes two to four weeks of trading on a daily chart. Chart watchers can recognize that traders were expressing optimism going into earnings, based on the price trend for LLY closing at the upper extremes of the volatility range. Chart watchers can also form an opinion of investor expectations by paying attention to option trading details. Prior to the announcement, traders appeared to be expecting that LLY shares would move upwards after earnings.\nTipThe Keltner Channel indicator displays a set of semi-parallel lines based on a 20-day simple moving average and an upper and lower line. Because the upper lines are drawn by adding a multiple of ATR to the average and the lower lines are drawn by subtracting a multiple of ATR from the average price, then this channel indicator makes for an excellent visualization tool when charting historical volatility. Trading Activity  The recent activity of options traders implies that they consider LLY shares undervalued and have bought call options as a bet that the stock will close within the box depicted in the chart between today and Aug. 20, the next monthly expiration date for options. The green-framed box represents the pricing that the call option sellers are offering. It implies a 70% chance that LLY shares will close inside this range or higher by Aug. 20. So sellers are only mildly bullish. However, buyers are snapping up this pricing, suggesting that buyers consider these options underpriced. Since the pricing implies only a 30% chance that prices could close above this green box, it appears that buyers are willing to take those long odds.\n It is important to note that open interest on Aug. 9 featured over 65,000 call options compared to over 90,000 puts, demonstrating the bias that option buyers had, as this normally implies that option traders expect downward price movement. After earnings, volatility has decreased dramatically, but the number of put options in the open interest increased. This signals a bearish sentiment.\n For strikes at the money and one step either direction, the call volume outweighs the put volume. Out-of-the money put volume declines at a much slower rate than out-of-the-money call volume. However, it should be noted that the implied volatility of this put option volume is declining, indicating that put options, while still being traded in large volumes, are being sold more than purchased.\n The purple lines on the chart are generated by a 10-day Keltner Channel study set at four times the ATR. This measure tends to create highly correlated regions of strong support and resistance in the price action. These regions show up when the channel lines make a noticeable turn within the previous three months.\n The levels that the turns mark are annotated in the chart below. What is notable in this chart is that the call and put pricing are in such disparity with plenty of space to run downwards. This suggests that option buyers have a stronger conviction of the price moving higher in the weeks following the report. Although investors and option traders expected positive movement from the report, the share price moved further to the upside than it did after the last earnings report.\n These support and resistance levels show a large range of support and resistance for prices. As a result, it is possible that there could be a large move in either direction in the near future. After the previous earnings announcement, LLY shares fell less than 1% in the day following before rising the following week. Investors may be expecting the same kind of move in price in the week after this announcement. With lots of room in the volatility range, share prices could rise or fall more than expected in the near term; however, there is more room in the volatility range to support a move to the downside.\n Wrapping Up  LLY beat expectations for revenue but missed analysts' predictions for EPS. The share price rose 2.5% the day after the announcement and has remained at the upper extreme of the volatility range, closing well above the 20-day moving average. Option traders appear to be buying calls and selling puts, which translates into a bullish outlook. This activity, however, does provide more room in the volatility range for a downward move in the share price in the future.\n Option Trading Example  As a bet on market probabilities, unusual option activity can offer traders insight into investor sentiment toward the company and illustrate what \"smart money\" is doing with large volume orders. One way to capture the bullish sentiment reflected in the post-earnings activity of LLY would be to open a debit call spread.\n A debit call spread, a type of vertical spread, is an option strategy that involves simultaneously buying and selling two call options with the same expiration date but different strike prices. Although there is an initial cost on the transaction, this strategy is based on the belief that the stock will rise in price, making the purchased call option more valuable in the future. The best-case scenario would be for LLY's share price to rise to or above the strike of the option sold. This would deliver the maximum amount of profit while limiting risk.\u00a0\n For example, to capture the bullish sentiment, buying the Sept. 10 $260 call costs $12.40 and has a breakeven price of $272.40. Selling the Sept. 10 $275 call will deliver a credit of $4.40, with a breakeven price of $279.40. After buying the $260 and selling the $275 call, the net debit for this trade is $8.00, or $800 per contract. The breakeven price of the trade at expiration is $268 (data snapshot as of 3:59 EDT, 8/9/2021). The chart below illustrates the setup for this particular debit call spread.\n No strategy is without risk. That maximum risk on this trade is the total debit paid for the trade, or $800 per contract. Because this strategy sells a call option with a higher strike than the one purchased, the potential profit is capped, as opposed to simply buying a call option by itself. For this particular example, the maximum potential gain is $700. The potential return on risk for this trade can be calculated as $700 / $800 = 87.5%.\nDo you have a news tip for Investopedia reporters?

The index is\u00a0weighted by market capitalization, which gives more significance to companies with larger market values. The top 25 stocks in the\u00a0S&P 500\u00a0by weight are the largest, most influential companies in the index.\nKey TakeawaysThe S&P 500 is widely considered to be one of the best measures of stock market performance and the health of the U.S. economy.The 500 stocks tracked by the index represent the nation's largest, most economically significant companiesThe S&P 500 is weighted by market cap. The larger the company, the more influence its stock price has on the overall index.The top 25 stocks in the index are important to follow because of their strong influence on the performance of the index and the economy at large. As of April 27, 2025, the S&P 500 index was down 6.3% since the beginning of the year, as increasing uncertainty about the effects of President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs created fears of a recession. Federal Reserve Board Chair Jerome Powell said on April 16 that the Fed will wait for \u201cgreater clarity\u201d before making any changes in interest rates. \"Unemployment is likely to go up as the economy slows, in all likelihood, and inflation is likely to go up as tariffs find their way and some part of those tariffs come to be paid by the public,\" he said.\n How are Stocks Selected for the S&P 500?  To be included in the S&P 500, a company must:\nBe based in the United States and trade publicly on a major U. S. exchangeMaintain a market capitalization of $20.5 billion and a float-adjusted market cap\u00a0of at least 50% of the index\u2019s total company-level minimum market capitalization thresholdHave reported positive\u00a0earnings\u00a0in the most recent quarter, along with the past four consecutive quartersHave a float-adjusted liquidity ratio of 0.75 or greater.Have traded a minimum of 250,000 shares in the previous six months before evaluation The S&P 500 reconstitutes each June. Companies removed from the index are not replaced until the next annual reconstitution. Top Sectors in the S&P 500  The table below lists the S&P 500's top sectors by weighting as of April 27, 2025. The information technology, financials, health care, and consumer discretionary sectors carry a cumulative weight of 66.74%. Meanwhile, the least-weighted sectors include energy, utilities, and real estate, which have a combined weight of just 8.64%.Top 10 Sectors in the S&P 500 by WeightInformation Technology31.03%Financials14.15%Health Care11.20%Consumer Discretionary10.36%Communications Services9.34%Industrials7.45%Consumer Staples6.03%Energy3.66%Utilities2.72%Real Estate2.26%\n\n Top 25 Companies by Index Weight  These are the top 25 companies by index weight. Since the S&P Global website does not disclose the weighting of component stocks, we used the S&P 500 exchange-traded fund (ETF), the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY), in order to cite index weighting. The ETF's holdings are a bit different, but SPY closely reflects the S&P 500 weights.\n As of April 27, 2025, here are the largest SPY holdings by weight:Top 25 Companies by Index Weight1APPLE (AAPL)6.69%2MICROSOFT (MSFT)6.23%3NVIDIA (NVDA)5.80%4\u00a0AMAZON.COM, INC (AMZN)3.81%5\u00a0META (META)2.56%6\u00a0BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY (BRK.B)2.55%7\u00a0ALPHABET CLASS A (GOOGL)2.02%8\u00a0BROADCOM (AVGO)1.92%9\u00a0TESLA (TSLA)1.70%10\u00a0ALPHABET CLASS C (GOOG)1.65%11\u00a0ELI LILLY (LLY)1.49%12\u00a0JP MORGAN (JPM)1.45%13\u00a0VISA (V)1.23%14\u00a0EXXON MOBIL (XOM)1.01%15\u00a0NETFLIX (NFLX)1.00%16\u00a0COSTCO (COST)0.93%17\u00a0MASTERCARD (MA)0.93%18\u00a0WALMART (WMT)0.88%19\u00a0UNITEDHEALTH GROUP (UNH)0.82%20\u00a0PROCTER AND GAMBLE (PG)0.81%21\u00a0JOHNSON & JOHNSON (JNJ)0.79%22\u00a0HOME DEPOT (HD)0.76%23\u00a0ABBVIE (ABBV)0.70%24\u00a0COCA COLA (KO)0.59%25\u00a0PHILLIP MORRIS INTERNATIONAL (PM)0.57%\n\n Why Are the S&P 500's Top 25 Stocks Important?  The top 25 stocks in the S&P 500 by index weight are important to analyze because they can be used to gauge the health of the stock market and broader economy. These companies reflect the performance of key sectors and the benchmark itself.\n The current period of outperformance by the technology sector, for example, shows how declining inflation, strong margins, and competitive positioning resulting in good cash flow can contribute to gains in the overall index.\n How Do I Invest in the S&P 500 Index?  The simplest and easiest way to invest in the S&P 500 is to purchase the popular SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY), which reflects the minute-by-minute movements of the index. Other ETFs that also track the S&P 500 this way include the iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (IVV) and Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO).\n There are also index funds that reflect only the closing price at the end of the day, including the Vanguard 500 Index Fund (VFIAX) and Fidelity 500 Index Fund (FXAIX).\u00a0For those interested in more complex strategies, options and futures are also available, such as E-mini S&P Futures contracts, although these are only for those wishing to speculate on the future value of the index. Advantages and Disadvantages of Investing in the S&P 500 Index  The central advantage of investing in the S&P 500 is the wide diversification it offers across many sectors and industries. By investing in the index, an investor generally reduces the risk associated with buying individual stocks. Over the years, an investment in the S&P 500 can produce long-term growth for those willing to wait out the accompanying short-term volatility.\n A disadvantage of S&P 500 investing is how concentrated the index is in the top-performing stocks, a factor that sometimes skews results and can result in increased volatility. Some investors prefer an S&P 500 Equal Weight Index, where each component has an equal weight without regard to the size of its market capitalization. The Bottom Line  The S&P 500 index weights companies according to their market caps. Larger firms are more heavily weighted than small firms, which carries some risks. The tech sector, which includes giants like Apple, Microsoft, and Nvidia, has an enormous influence on index results. In general, the stock market\u2019s health and that of the U.S. economy can be measured by analyzing the S&P 500\u2019s top 25 components.\nThe comments, opinions, and analyses expressed on Investopedia are for informational purposes only.

{"url": "https://www.investopedia.com/the-best-health-care-stocks-8782134", "title": "Best Health Care Stocks to Watch in May 2025", "text": " The health care sector is massive and incredibly varied, including companies that make medical equipment or drugs, those that offer medical services, and even those providing insurance in some cases. Within this sector, there are startups that are pre-revenue and working from quarter to quarter to launch an innovative product, major legacy service providers, and everything in between. Investors thus have many options to choose from when focused on health care. At the same time, though, the health care sector is highly complex, and investors are cautioned to familiarize themselves with the ins and outs of health care companies before investing.\nKey TakeawaysSome of the best health care stocks for May 2025, based on 30-day returns, include Nutex Health Inc. (NUTX), Summit Therapeutics Inc. (SMMT), and Zhengye Biotechnology Holding Ltd. (ZYBT).The best-performing health care stocks in the last month returned at least 18.7%.An aging population and increasing medical needs are two factors contributing to massive growth in the health sector. We examine several of the best health care stocks to watch for May 2025, based on highest 30-day percentage return. We include an explanation of the other factors in our screen below. All data are current as of April 24, 2025.Best Health Care Stocks to Watch in May 2025\u00a0TickerCompanyMarket Cap ($B)Price ($)30-Day Return (%)P/E RatioNUTXNutex Health Inc.0.7134.00125.714.5SMMTSummit Therapeutics Inc.25.134.0565.2N/AZYBTZhengye Biotechnology Holding Ltd.0.48.6250.7N/ASLNOSoleno Therapeutics Inc.3.671.8141.5N/AAMLXAmylyx Pharmaceuticals Inc.0.55.1434.2N/ATMDXTransMedics Group Inc.3.294.2031.893.3ASPIASP Isotopes Inc.0.45.7429.9N/AKROSKeros Therapeutics Inc.0.614.4326.5N/ACORTCorcept Therapeutics Inc.7.671.5820.358.0PLSEPulse Biosciences Inc.1.318.9018.7N/ASource: TradingView\n\n What to Know About the Health Care Sector  The health care sector was among the hardest hit by the COVID-19 pandemic and has yet to fully recover; the sector continues to face a significant labor shortage that has been exacerbated by ongoing inflation concerns. Significant elements of the way health care operations function\u2014from a shift away from in-person medical appointments to changes in insurance and demand for new products, among many others\u2014have forced long-time leaders in the space to reevaluate their offerings and presented openings for upstart firms to gain a foothold. Going forward, the health care sector will wrestle with a growing population of patients who are eligible for Medicaid and Medicare, opportunities presented by AI, and more.\n One trend for investors to keep a close eye on is the ongoing popularity of GLP-1 agonists, a type of drug used to treat Type 2 diabetes and to help with weight loss. With about 1 billion people globally living with obesity, the potential market for these drugs is incredibly large. The two leading providers of these drugs are Novo Nordisk A/S (NVO) and Eli Lilly and Co. (LLY), but the market is far from settled. How We Chose the Best Health Care Stocks  To screen for the best health care stocks this month, we looked at firms listed on either the Nasdaq or the New York Stock Exchange. To ensure we focused on established companies, we filtered out any companies with a share price below $5, with a minimum daily trading volume of under 100,000, and with a market capitalization below $300 million. From that subset of stocks, we ranked companies according to the highest 30-day percentage return.\n Notably, all but three of the companies in our results had no P/E ratio. One of the most common reasons for a company to not have a P/E ratio is if it either took a loss or generated no earnings in the given time period, or in the prior-year period for comparison. This makes the calculation of a P/E ratio impossible. For clinical-stage pharmaceutical firms, many of which are pre-revenue or consistently post losses while developing their products, it is common to not have a P/E ratio until the launch of a significant drug product. Health Care Stock Advantages and Disadvantages  National health expenditures reached $4.9 trillion in 2023, making the health care sector massive. A key benefit health care provides to investors is consistent demand. Because individuals will always have medical needs to be met, the overall demand for health products and services typically remains at least constant and tends to increase over time as populations grow older. Nationwide health care expenditures are expected to surge to $6.8 trillion by the year 2030.Health care companies are enticing to investors because they are highly incentivized to use and create new technology, both to meet rising demand and to improve the affordability of care they can offer. This focus on innovation may mean that health care stocks offer the potential for short- and long-term gains.\n It is common in the sector for individual companies to experience a significant breakout when an important new product is launched\u2014such as a new medical device with broad applications or a blockbuster new drug\u2014or even when clinical trial data is encouraging. Health care stocks often experience astronomical rallies during these moments.\n On the other hand, there are some risks to investing in health care companies that investors should be aware of as well. One of the biggest risks is the size and scope of the sector. Due to the technical nature of the work of many health care companies, it can be difficult for outside investors to accurately assess the viability of a company or its products. Additionally, many companies in the space are heavily impacted by legislation, which can change and contribute to volatility.\n Undoubtedly there are opportunities for major returns for investors looking to the health care sector. However, no one can predict how a company's stock may perform. The companies above led the sector in our screen, but past performance is not a guarantee of future returns.\n The Bottom Line  The health care sector is massive, complex, and rich with opportunities for investors willing to take the time to understand its ins and outs. Our screen favors companies in the pharmaceuticals space that have experienced strong returns in the last month, occasionally due to the success of a popular drug or other product. But just as some of these firms may rise rapidly, they may also fall just as precipitously, particularly if a promising new product ends up not working as expected.\nThe comments, opinions, and analyses expressed on Investopedia are for informational purposes only.

The drugmaker posted adjusted earnings per share of $3.34 on revenue that increased 45% year-over-year to $12.73 billion. Analysts surveyed by Visible Alpha projected $3.25 and $12.62 billion, respectively.\n Sales of Lilly's blockbuster weight-loss drugs Mounjaro and Zepbound rose to $3.84 billion and $2.31 billion, respectively. Mounjaro sales topped expectations of $3.76 billion and Zepbound fell just short of the $2.33 billion consensus. Revenue Outlook Affirmed, Profit Forecasts Cut  Lilly affirmed its full-year revenue guidance, but lowered its profit forecasts. Last quarter, it said it expected 2025 revenue between $58.0 to $61.0 billion, with EPS from $22.05 to $23.55, and adjusted EPS of $22.50 to $24.00.\n EPS is now forecast within a range of $20.17 to $21.67, while adjusted EPS is now projected at $20.78 to $22.28. The drugmaker said the reduction is due to \"net losses on investments in equity securities,\" along with acquired in-process research and development (IPR&D) charges, which came in at about $1.57 billion in the first quarter. Shares, which entered the day up more than 16% this year, were down more than 7% shortly after markets opened.\nUPDATE\u2014This article has been updated with the latest share price information.Do you have a news tip for Investopedia reporters?

{"url": "https://www.investopedia.com/eli-lilly-lly-option-traders-prepped-for-earnings-beat-5195443", "title": "Eli Lilly (LLY) Option Traders Prepped for Earnings Beat", "text": " Optimistic investors have bid up the share prices of Eli Lilly and Company (LLY) ahead of its fiscal second quarter earnings report. At first glance, it appears that option traders are anticipating a positive move, as there are a high number of put options being sold in the open interest. This unusual option trading may create a downward trend in the price action if LLY delivers a negative earnings surprise.\n A notable number of put options remain in the open interest for LLY, and option premiums are elevated right now. Option trading volumes indicate that traders have been buying calls and selling puts in anticipation of a positive earnings report. If these bets were to unwind, it could result in unexpected downward pressure on the share price of Eli Lilly.\n It is difficult to accurately predict the direction a stock will move after earnings. However, a comparison between the stock's price action and option trading activity shows that, if Eli Lilly delivers a negative report, the company's share price could fall significantly, moving closer to its 20-day moving average in the days after the announcement. This is possible because options are priced for an upwards move, but unexpected poor news could catch traders off guard and create a rapid decline in share price.\nKey TakeawaysTraders and investors have bid up Eli Lilly share prices to an extreme range headed into the earnings announcement.The share price has been closing well above its 20-day moving average.Call and put pricing is predicting a stronger upwards move.The volatility-based support and resistance levels allow for a stronger move to the downside.This setup creates an opportunity for traders to profit from unforeseen earnings results. Option trading is a literal bet on market probabilities. By comparing the details of both stock price and option behavior, chart watchers can gain valuable insight, although it helps to understand the context in which this price behavior took place. The chart below illustrates the share price action for LLY as of Friday, July 30. This created the setup leading into the earnings report.\n Current Trends  The one-month trend of LLY stock has the shares ascending into an extreme range. It is notable that, over the past month, the highest LLY share price was near $248 in late July. The lowest share price was roughly $217 in late June. The price closed in the upper region depicted by the technical studies on this chart.\n The studies are formed by 20-day Keltner Channel indicators. These depict price levels that represent a multiple of the Average True Range (ATR) for the stock. This array helps to highlight the way the price has moved to a higher range all month. This price move from LLY shares implies that investors expect a positive earnings result.\nTipThe Average True Range (ATR) has become a standard tool for depicting historical volatility over time. The typical average length of time used in its calculation is 10 to 20 time periods, which includes two to four weeks of trading on a daily chart. In this context where the price trend for Eli Lilly has been rising to an extreme range, chart watchers can recognize that traders and investors are expressing optimism going into earnings. In the week before earnings, LLY's share price reached its all-time high, before slightly pulling back at the end of the week. That makes it important for chart watchers to determine whether the move is reflecting investors' expectations for a favorable earnings report or not.\n Option trading details can provide additional context to assist chart watchers in forming an opinion about investor expectations. Recently, option traders are favoring calls over puts by over 2-to-1, as Friday's option volume had a greater number of calls than puts. It should be noted that there are a higher number of puts than calls in the open interest, but it appears that traders are selling these options. Normally, this suggests that investors are expecting a positive earnings report and that traders appear to be expecting LLY to move higher after earnings.\nTipThe Keltner Channel indicator displays a set of semi-parallel lines based on a 20-day simple moving average and an upper and lower line. Because the upper lines are drawn by adding a multiple of ATR to the average and the lower lines are drawn by subtracting a multiple of ATR from the average price, then this channel indicator makes for an excellent visualization tool when charting historical volatility. Trading Activity  Option traders recognize that LLY shares are in an extreme range and have priced their options as a bet that the stock will close within one of the two boxes depicted in the chart between today and Aug. 6, the Friday after the earnings report is released. The green-framed box represents the pricing that call option sellers are offering. It implies a 37% that Eli Lilly shares will close inside this range by the end of the week if prices go higher. The red box represented the pricing for put options with a 31% probability if prices go lower on the announcement.\n It's important to note that the open interest featured over 59,000 active call options compared to roughly 88,000 put options, demonstrating the bias that option buyers had, as well over half of the trades were put options. This amount normally implies that put option traders expect a decline in price, but it should be noted that it appears these put options are being sold, reflecting a bullish outlook. However, because the call box and put box are relatively equal in size, it tells us that the high percentage of options traded has only mildly skewed expectations higher. A far more complacent outlook is implied.\n The purple lines on the chart are generated by a 10-day Keltner Channel study set at four times the ATR. This measure tends to create highly correlated regions of strong support and resistance in the price action. These regions show up when the channel lines make a noticeable turn within the previous three months.\n The levels that the turns mark are annotated in the chart below. What is notable in this chart is that the call and put pricing are in such a close range with plenty of space to run downwards compared to upwards. This suggests that option buyers don't have a strong conviction about how the company will report, even though calls are being purchased over puts. Although investors and option traders do not expect it, a surprising report could push prices dramatically higher or lower.\n These support and resistance levels show a large range of support and resistance for prices. As a result, it is possible that any news, surprisingly bad or good, will catch investors by surprise and could generate an unusually large move. After the previous earnings announcement, LLY shares fell by 0.91% in the day following and gradually rose the following week, climbing above the 20-day moving average for several weeks. Investors may be expecting the same kind of move in the price after this announcement. With plenty of room in the volatility range, share prices could rise or fall more than expected.\n Market Impact  Eli Lilly is one of the largest pharmaceutical companies in the world, so its earnings results may have a direct effect on index prices. No matter what the report says, it will likely have a significant impact on stocks in the health care sector. A positive report could lift other stocks in the sector such as Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), Pfizer Inc. (PFE), or AbbVie Inc. (ABBV). It could also affect exchange traded funds (ETFs) such as State Street's Health Care Sector ETF (XLV) or Invesco's Dynamic Pharmaceuticals ETF (PJP).\nDo you have a news tip for Investopedia reporters?

Thursday marked the company\u2019s fourth-worst day on Wall Street since going public in 1984.\u00a0\n UnitedHealth\u2019s precipitous drop rippled through the stock market. Fellow health insurers Humana (HUM) and Elevance Health (ELV) dropped 7.4% and 2.4%, respectively. And UnitedHealth, the priciest stock in the price-weighted Dow Jones Industrial Average, detracted an estimated 789 points from the blue-chip index, which fell 1.3%; if UnitedHealth stock hadn\u2019t moved at all today, the Dow would have risen 262 points, or 0.7%.\n UnitedHealth\u2019s slump erased about $120 billion off its market capitalization, which puts it among the costliest stock routs of all time. It\u2019s the kind of wealth-decimating drop that\u2019s rarely seen outside of the tech sector, where corporate valuations are underpinned by growth expectations that can balloon and, in moments of crisis, pop.\u00a0Meta (META), for example, became the first company to lose more than $100 billion in a single day in 2018 after the company\u2014then called Facebook\u2014reported disappointing quarterly revenue. In defensive sectors like health care and consumer staples, companies usually lose that kind of market value over long periods of slow decline. Pharmacy giant Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) and cosmetics giant Est\u00e9e Lauder (EL), for example, have each lost about $100 billion in value over the last 10 and 3 years, respectively, as they\u2019ve struggled with slumping sales.\u00a0\n To be sure, UnitedHealth, with a $535 billion market cap, was the 14th largest company in the S&P 500 heading into Thursday\u2019s session, giving it lots of market value to lose. Outside of the tech sector, only Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B), Eli Lilly (LLY), Walmart (WMT), JPMorgan Chase (JPM), and Visa (V) were worth more before Thursday. Still, companies of UnitedHealth\u2019s size often operate stable businesses that require a massive shock, like Covid-19, to suffer the kind of sell-off seen Thursday.\nDo you have a news tip for Investopedia reporters?

Here's what investors need to know today.\n 1. US Stock Futures Edging Mostly Higher as Investors Await More Earnings  U.S. stock futures are edging mostly higher as investors await more corporate earnings. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures are ticking higher after gains from Nvidia (NVDA) pushed the blue chip index higher by 0.7% Wednesday. Nasdaq and S&P 500 are slightly higher and lower, respectively after posting modest gains yesterday. Bitcoin (BTCUSD) is up 2% to trade near $99,000. Yields on the 10-year Treasury note and oil futures are higher, while gold futures are little changed.\n 2. Conglomerate Honeywell to Split into Three Companies  Honeywell (HON) has announced it would move to split its Automation, Aerospace Technologies, and Advanced Materials divisions into three separate companies by the second half of 2026. Honeywell also reported fourth-quarter revenue and adjusted earnings per share (EPS) that beat Visible Alpha consensus estimates, but its GAAP profit came in short of expectations. Shares are down 1% in premarket trading.\n 3. Qualcomm Stock Falls as Licensing Revenue Comes Up Short of Estimates  Qualcomm (QCOM) shares are dropping by 4% in premarket trading after the chipmaker reported lower-than-expected licensing revenue despite posting record sales. The company reported a 17% year-over-year jump in revenue to $11.67 billion and profit of $3.18 billion, or $2.83 per share, both topping Visible Alpha estimates. But the revenue the company gets from licensing products to companies like Apple (AAPL) came in at $1.54 billion, a tick below estimates.\n 4. Eli Lilly Adjusted Profit Tops Estimates; Weight-Loss Drug Sales Fall Short  Eli Lilly (LLY) shares are about 1% higher in premarket trading after the drugmaker's adjusted profit came in above estimates, despite reporting mostly worse-than-expected fourth-quarter results. The company reported net income of $4.41 billion, or $4.88 per share, on revenue of $13.53 billion, below Visible Alpha estimates. Adjusted EPS of $5.32 topped expectations of $5.11. Sales of the company's blockbuster weight-loss drugs Mounjaro and Zepbound grew to $3.53 billion and $1.91 billion, respectively, below projections. 5. Amazon Expected to Report Strong Sales After Bell  Amazon (AMZN) is scheduled to report fourth-quarter results after markets close today, and the \u201cMagnificent 7\u201d member is expected to post strong sales following a record-breaking holiday shopping season. All 27 analysts covering the stock tracked by Visible Alpha have a \"buy\" or equivalent rating, giving it a consensus price target of $259, about 10% higher than Wednesday's close.

Undertsanding Johnson & Johnson  On July 12, 2018, a Missouri jury\u00a0ordered that the company\u00a0pay\u00a0$4.69 billion to 22 women who accused the company's talc-based products, including its baby powder, of containing asbestos and causing\u00a0them to develop ovarian cancer. In 2017, lawsuits were\u00a0mostly filed in state courts in Missouri, New Jersey, and California. The company\u00a0denies both that its talc products cause cancer and that they have ever contained asbestos.\u00a0However, the company still faces thousands of pending lawsuits. In April 2020, a U.S. District judge from New Jersey made a decision regarding the expert witnesses that can be called by both sides. The decision paves the way for the trial to proceed in which J&J faces thousands of allegations from those claiming that the company's talcum powder causes cancer.\n The 38,000 lawsuits filed against Johnson & Johnson related to the baby powder, however, have been halted as of November 2021. The case is delayed for two months and will be heard in the company\u2019s headquarters in New Jersey. The company has removed its talc powder from store shelves in the U.S. and Canada. Despite the company's legal challenges, J&J developed a single-shot COVID-19 vaccine.

Founded in 1886 by three brothers, the company is headquartered in New Brunswick, New Jersey. It operates more than 250 different subsidiaries in over 60 countries, employing over 130,000 people. The company trades on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) with a share price of approximately $167 as of Dec. 2021, with a market capitalization of over $442 billion. JNJ reported $82.58 billion in revenue for the 2020 fiscal year\u2014$43.13 billion from the United States while the remaining $39.45 billion came from international sources. Johnson & Johnson derives its profitability from three distinct segments\u2014pharmaceuticals, medical devices, and consumer products. In Nov. 2021, the company announced plans to split into two publicly traded companies. One will be made up of the company's pharmaceuticals and medical devices business, and the other will be comprised of J&J's consumer products business. The split is expected to be completed by the end of 2023.Key TakeawaysJohnson & Johnson is a giant in the health care space that was founded in 1886.The multi-billion market cap company has three key segments\u2014pharmaceuticals, medical devices, and consumer products.\u00a0The pharmaceuticals business makes up roughly over half of J&J's pretax income, medical devices almost 30%, and the consumer products division making up the rest.In Nov. 2021, J&J announced plans to split into two publicly traded companies\u2014one made up of the pharmaceuticals and medical devices businesses and the other comprised of consumer products.Despite successfully developing the world's first single-dose COVID-19 vaccine in 2020, JNJ had some challenges because of potential side effects and quality control issues. Pharmaceuticals  The pharmaceutical segment of Johnson & Johnson generates the majority of the company's sales. This division accounted for more than half of JNJ's revenue for the full year. At over 55% of overall revenue, pharmaceuticals drew in a total of $45.57 billion in sales. This was a growth of 8.4% from the previous year.\n The company pointed to several highlights that boosted growth in the segment, including demand for some of its key biologic medications. These medications are used in the treatment of immune-mediated inflammatory diseases, cancer, psoriatic arthritis, and schizophrenia. JNJ developed the world's first single-dose COVID-19 vaccine, which contributed to its financial success for the fiscal year. Federal authorities in the United States approved the use of the vaccine in the fight against the pandemic in February 2021. Clinical trials demonstrated that the vaccine was 85% effective against the virus. The U.S. rollout for the JNJ vaccine was stalled, following reports of severe side effects and issues with quality control. But the company's international vaccine rollout has progressed, with the U.K. government authorizing it for emergency use in May 2021. The vaccine was approved for use in Canada for adults ages 18 and older in late 2021. Plans are in the works to expand its use in lower-income countries, most recently donating almost 100 million doses in November 2021.ImportantJ&J's profitability is not broken down by region but the company does disclose U.S. and international sales totals. Medical Devices  This division is divided into four different areas, including:\nOrthopedics: joint reconstruction, trauma, spine, sports medicine, and power toolsSurgery: surgical systems and instrumentsInterventional solutions: heart rhythm disorders and neurovascular care support for health care professionalsVision Revenue for the medical devices segment dropped in 2020 by 10.5%. The company attributed this to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic as well as medical procedure deferrals. Medical devices generated about $22.96 billion in sales, which represented 27.8% of total revenue for the year. Despite the challenges, the company\u2014and the industry\u2014experienced during the year because of the pandemic, Johnson & Johnson said it concentrated its efforts on urgent needs by training over six million medical workers and providing personal protective equipment.ImportantJNJ is a major innovator in the health care sector. In fact, it was the very first company to produce dental floss, feminine hygiene products, first aid kids, and maternity kits on a mass scale. Consumer Products Johnson & Johnson's consumer products segment offers a broad range of products used in three distinct categories:\nSkin healthSelf-careEssential health These categories provide consumers with a wide range of products ranging from baby care, oral care, beauty products, women's health, wound care, to over-the-counter medicines like Tylenol, Motrin, Zyrtec, and Benadryl. This segment was responsible for 17% of total sales, representing $14.05 billion of revenue for the full year. According to the earnings report, the division's sales grew by 3% from the previous year, fueled by demand for some of its key brand names, including Tylenol and Listerine. The company also highlighted the launch of about 200 new product lines during the fiscal year. This included the release of a digital smoking cessation tool in the United Kingdom.", "tags": ["www.investopedia.com", "articles", "wwwinvestopediacom"]}

{"url": "https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/120415/how-dividendpaying-etfs-work.asp", "title": "How Do ETF Dividends Work?", "text": " One of the ways that investors make money from exchange-traded funds (ETFs) is through dividends that are paid to the ETF issuer and then paid on to their investors in proportion to the number of shares each holds.\n If you\u2019re looking for an ETF that pays a steady stream of income, you might consider one of the many ETFs that focus on investments that historically have paid high dividends.\n ETF issuers decide whether to pay these dividends directly, or reinvest them in the fund and pay them out at a later payout date. The fund prospectus makes it clear which it is. Investors can also choose to automatically reinvest their dividends in additional shares of the ETF.\nKey TakeawaysInvestors make money from exchange-traded funds (ETFs) through dividends.ETF sponsors set an ex-dividend date, a record date, and a payment date that determine who will receive the dividend and when it will be paid.ETFs control the amount and timing of income tax to the investor, primarily due to how and when the taxable capital gains are captured.In addition to dividend-oriented ETFs, there are\u00a0dividend-focused ETFs that employ various strategies to increase dividend yield. Timing of ETF Dividend Payments  Like any company that issues a stock dividend, an ETF\u2019s sponsor sets an ex-dividend date, a record date, and a payment date. These dates determine who will receive the dividend and when it will be paid. The timing of these dividend payments is on a different schedule than that of the underlying stocks and is set by the ETF sponsor.\n For example, the ex-dividend date for the popular SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY) is the third Friday of the final month of a fiscal quarter (March, June, September, and December). If that date is not a business day, the ex-dividend date falls on the prior business day. At the end of each quarter, the SPDR S&P 500 ETF distributes the dividends. These dates are listed in the fund\u2019s prospectus, which is publicly available to all investors.\n Just as like any stock shares, the price of an ETF often rises before the ex-dividend date\u2014reflecting a flurry of buying activity\u2014and falls afterward, as\u00a0investors who own the fund before the ex-dividend date receive the dividend, and those buying afterward do not.\n Dividends Paid in Cash  The SPDR S&P 500 ETF pays out dividends in cash. According to the fund\u2019s prospectus, the SPDR S&P 500 ETF puts all dividends it receives from its underlying stock holdings into a non-interest-bearing account until it comes time to make a payout. At the end of the fiscal quarter, when dividends are due to be paid, the SPDR S&P 500 ETF pulls the dividends from the non-interest-bearing account and distributes them proportionally to the investors. Some ETFs may temporarily reinvest the dividends from the underlying stocks into the holdings of the fund until it comes time to make a cash dividend payment. Naturally, this creates a small amount of leverage in the fund, which can slightly improve its performance during bull markets and slightly harm its performance during bear markets.\n Dividends Reinvested  ETF investors also have the option of automatically reinvesting dividends into additional shares of the ETF rather than receiving them as cash. It comes out to the same value. However, the shares can, of course, gain or lose value after they are purchased.\n Dividends Are Taxable  These reinvestments can be seen as a benefit, as they do not cost the investor a trade fee to purchase the additional shares through dividend reinvestment. Online brokers typically don\u2019t charge commission anymore for regular trades.\n However, each shareholder\u2019s annual dividends are taxable in the year they are received, even if they are received via dividend reinvestment. Taxes on Dividends in ETFs  ETFs are often viewed as a favorable alternative to mutual funds in terms of their ability to control the amount and timing of income tax to the investor. However, this is primarily due to how and when the taxable capital gains are captured in ETFs.\n Owning dividend-producing ETFs does not defer the tax on the dividends paid by an ETF during a tax year. The dividends that an ETF pays are taxable to the investor in essentially the same way as the dividends paid by a mutual fund are taxable. Examples of Dividend-Paying ETFs  Here are five popular dividend-oriented ETFs.\n 1. SPDR S&P Dividend ETF (SDY)  The\u00a0SPDR S&P Dividend ETF (SDY)\u00a0is the most extreme and exclusive of the dividend ETFs. It\u00a0tracks the S&P High Yield Dividend Aristocrats Index, which includes companies in the S&P Composite 1500 that have increased their dividends for at least 20 consecutive years. Due to their long history of reliably paying these dividends, these companies are often considered less risky for investors seeking total return. 2. Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF (VIG)  The\u00a0Vanguard\u00a0Dividend Appreciation ETF (VIG) tracks the S&P U.S. Dividend Growers Index, a\u00a0market capitalization-weighted grouping of companies that have increased dividends for a minimum of 10 consecutive years.\n Its assets are invested domestically, and the\u00a0portfolio includes many companies known for paying rich dividends, such as Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ). 3. iShares Select Dividend ETF (DVY)  The iShares Select Dividend ETF (DVY) is the largest ETF to track a dividend-weighted index. Similar to VIG, this ETF invests in U.S. companies, but the companies representing the hardest portions of the portfolio differ a bit.\n Over one-quarter of the 100 stocks in DVY\u2019s portfolio are utility companies. Other major sectors represented include financials, consumer staples, energy, and communication stocks. 4. iShares Core High Dividend ETF (HDV)  BlackRock\u2019s iShares Core High Dividend ETF (HDV) is younger and uses a smaller portfolio than the company\u2019s other notable high-yield option, DVY. This ETF tracks a\u00a0Morningstar-constructed index of 75 U.S. stocks screened by dividend sustainability and earnings potential, which are two hallmarks of the Benjamin Graham and Warren Buffett school of fundamental analysis.\n In fact, Morningstar\u2019s sustainability ratings are driven by Buffett\u2019s concept of an \u201ceconomic moat\u201d that some businesses create to insulate themselves from their rivals. 5. Vanguard High Dividend Yield ETF (VYM)  The Vanguard High Dividend Yield ETF (VYM) is characteristically low-cost and straightforward, like most Vanguard offerings. It tracks the FTSE High Dividend Yield Index\u00a0effectively and demonstrates outstanding tradability for all investor demographics.\n A particular quirk of the investment strategy for VYM is its focus on companies that pay very high dividends. The two most represented sectors in this ETF\u2019s holdings are financials and healthcare. Other Income-Oriented ETFs  In addition to these five funds, there are\u00a0dividend-focused ETFs that employ various strategies to increase dividend yield.\n ETFs such as the iShares Preferred and Income Securities ETF (PFF) track a basket of preferred stocks from U.S. companies. The dividend yields on preferred stock ETFs should be substantially more than those of traditional common stock ETFs because preferred stocks behave more like bonds than equities and do not benefit from the appreciation of the company\u2019s stock price in the same manner. Real estate investment trust ETFs, such as the Vanguard Real Estate ETF (VNQ), track publicly traded equity real estate investment trusts (REITs). Due to the nature of REITs, the dividend yields tend to be higher than those of common stock ETFs. There are also international equity ETFs, such as the WisdomTree Emerging Markets High Dividend Fund (DEM)\u00a0or the First Trust Dow Jones Global Select Dividend Index Fund\u00a0(FGD),\u00a0which track higher-than-normal dividend-paying companies domiciled outside of the United States.How Do Dividends Work in an ETF?ETF issuers collect any dividends paid by the companies whose stocks are held in the fund, and they then pay those dividends to their shareholders. The shareholders can choose to receive dividends as cash or reinvest them in additional ETF shares.Not all ETFs earn dividends for their shareholders, and some ETFs are invested primarily in stocks that historically pay high dividends to their shareholders.If you\u2019re interested in investing in an ETF that produces regular income that is paid directly to you, check the prospectus to find out whether dividends are paid out to investors or reinvested in the fund.Do I Owe Taxes on My ETF Dividends?Yes. Dividends paid through an ETF or through a traditional mutual fund are taxed exactly as stock dividends are. The taxes are due in the year that the dividend payment is received, whether the dividend is paid to the shareholder or reinvested in the fund.What Is a Dividend?A dividend is a share in a company\u2019s profit for a quarter or a year that is paid to each of its investors. Some companies pay no dividends at all, relying on fast growth in their share prices to attract investors. At the other end of the spectrum, many well-established and profitable companies pay good dividends year after year. Their investors aren\u2019t buying and selling their shares to make a fast profit. They\u2019re holding onto their shares to create a steady stream of income. The Bottom Line  Although ETFs are best known for tracking broad indexes such as the S&P 500 or the Russell 2000, many ETFs focus on dividend-paying stocks.\n Historically, dividends have accounted for about 41% of the total returns of the stock market, and a strong dividend payout history is one of the oldest and surest signs of corporate profitability. If your goal is steady income, you might look at one of the many ETFs that focus on dividend-paying companies.\n", "tags": ["www.investopedia.com", "articles", "wwwinvestopediacom"]}

One will inherit J&J's extensive portfolio of well-known consumer products, while the other will continue to develop, produce, and distribute pharmaceuticals, medical devices, and medical technology. Johnson & Johnson indicates that the transaction will take place sometime over the next 18 to 24 months and that the pharmaceutical, medical devices, and medical technology company will retain the Johnson & Johnson name. The initial reaction of the markets was positive. As of 11:50 a.m. Eastern Standard Time on Nov. 12, 2021, the date of the announcement, shares of JNJ were up by about 1.3% for the day. However, even after this advance, they were trading 8.2% below their 52-week high reached in August 2021.Key TakeawaysJohnson & Johnson (JNJ) will split into two public companies within the next 18 to 24 months.One will get its many consumer brands, while the other will get its pharmaceuticals, medical devices, and medical technology businesses.The consumer company is yet to be named, while the drug company will keep the Johnson & Johnson name.The consumer division currently generates about $15 billion in annual sales, while the faster-growing drug unit produces about $77 billion. Separating Products and Brands  The new consumer products company, which has yet to be named, will own such well-known brands as Band-Aid bandages, Aveeno and Neutrogena skin care products, Tylenol pain relief products, Johnson's Baby Care products, and Listerine mouthwash, among others. Meanwhile, the pharmaceuticals, medical devices, and medical technology company, which will retain the Johnson & Johnson name, will have its one-dose COVID-19 vaccine among its many products, as well as advanced medical technologies such as robotics and artificial intelligence (AI). The incoming CEO of J&J, Joaquin Duato, will head the latter company when the split takes place. J&J indicates that the consumer division is projected to generate sales of about $15 billion in 2021, while the faster-growing pharmaceuticals, medical devices, and medical technology unit is on track to deliver about $77 billion in revenue. J&J's consumer division has four brands that each produce over $1 billion in annual sales. It also owns 20 brands that each generate over $150 million in yearly revenues. A key risk for the consumer products company will be litigation claiming that Johnson's Baby Powder is carcinogenic. J&J has denied this claim vigorously. Strategic Rationale  Outgoing J&J CEO Alex Gorsky said this in a statement about the planned split of the company: \"Following a comprehensive review, the board and management team believe that the planned separation of the consumer health business is the best way to accelerate our efforts to serve patients, consumers, and healthcare professionals, create opportunities for our talented global team, drive profitable growth, and\u2014most importantly\u2014improve healthcare outcomes for people around the world.\" In an interview, Gorsky indicated that J&J's board has discussed this move for \"some time,\" and he anticipates that it will produce \"tremendous opportunity\" to stakeholders. He added: \"It's in the best long-term interest of all our stakeholders. Our goal is really to create two global leaders\u2014a pharmaceutical and medical device business that has great potential today ... and of course, the consumer business that's got iconic brands.\" Gorsky also claimed that the split would be an especially positive development for J&J's extensive lineup of consumer products. He asserted that, as a separate company, the consumer division will have \"even more agility\" and \u201ca better opportunity for capital allocation.\"Do you have a news tip for Investopedia reporters?

The company, which was founded in 1886, is based in New Brunswick, New Jersey, and employs more than 130,000 people in 60 different countries. The company was among the first to produce sterile surgical supplies on a mass scale before moving into pharmaceuticals and consumer health products. The company is also among a handful of others that released a vaccine in 2020 against the COVID-19 virus, which promises to bode well. This article looks at the Dow component's financial results for the fourth quarter of 2020 and how the market reacted.\nKey TakeawaysJohnson & Johnson is trading higher after beating fourth quarter estimates and raising 2021 guidance.Sales dropped in the medical devices division but increased in both pharmaceuticals and the consumer health division in Q4-2020.The company produced single-dose COVID-19 vaccines.Price structure forecasts continued upside into the $190s. JNJ's Fourth Quarter Results Johnson & Johnson traded at an all-time high after beating fourth quarter 2020 top- and bottom-line estimates and raising 2021 earnings per share (EPS) guidance above consensus. The health care giant posted a profit of $1.86 per share, $0.03 better than estimates, while revenue rose 8.7% year over year to $22.5 billion, nearly $1 billion higher than expectations.Sales in the company's pharmaceutical division grew by 8.4% while the consumer health division grew in the fourth quarter of 2020 by just 3.1%. This was driven by sales of over-the-counter products, such as Tylenol, Pepcid, and Listerine. Johnson & Johnson's medical devices unit, though, posted a 10.5% decline because of the global COVID-19 pandemic and delays in medical procedures. J&J's chief financial officer (CFO) Joe Wolk offered optimistic comments on the company's COVID-19 vaccine. At the time the financial results were released, Wolk said he expected it would rival the efficacy of those offered by Moderna (MRNA) and Pfizer (PFE). The company received authorization for emergency use for its single-dose vaccine by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in February 2021, which the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said was 66.3% effective in clinical trials.Wall Street consensus on Johnson & Johnson didn't change following the results, as the company maintained an overweight rating based on nine buy and four hold recommendations. One analyst dropped J&J to underweight, possibly triggered by the company's baby powder exposure. Price targets in the first quarter of 2021 ranged from a low of $139 to a Street-high $181.\nImportantWhile the company has a single-dose vaccine that was authorized for emergency use by the FDA for the coronavirus, J&J is conducting Phase 3 clinical trials for a two-dose vaccine regimen. Johnson & Johnson Monthly Chart (2000\u20132021) TradingView.com A multi-year uptrend topped out near $70 in 2005, marking resistance that wasn't breached until a 2013 breakout attracted healthy buying interest. The uptick topped out at $110 in 2014 and resumed in 2016, topping out once again in the first quarter of 2018 when President Trump fired the first shot in the trade war with China. Breakout attempts failed in the fourth quarter of 2018 and second quarter of 2019, while a buying impulse into February 2020 reached the mid-$150s.\n The stock failed that breakout during the pandemic decline into March, posting a higher low in the $130s and easing into a V-shaped recovery that completed a round trip into the prior high in April. Price action finally completed a breakout to new highs at the end of 2020, setting the stage for strong 2021 returns. The stock is currently trading near $170, with broad price structure forecasting a measured move target in the $190s.\n Strong price action into January 2021 also busted through the top of a three-year broadening formation, also known as a megaphone pattern. This is extremely bullish, taking a potentially bearish pattern off the table while setting up a low-risk buying opportunity near $160. The breakout suggests that the market has discounted liability from the baby powder controversy, despite more than 20,000 active cases and numerous appeals.\nFast FactA broadening formation is a price chart pattern identified by technical analysts, which is characterized by increasing price volatility and visualized as two diverging trend lines\u2014one rising and one falling. It usually occurs after a significant rise or fall in the action of security prices. The Bottom Line  Established in 1886, New Jersey-based Johnson & Johnson is one of the most recognizable names in the world of pharmaceuticals, medical devices, and consumer health products. Consumers can find some of its most well-known brand names anywhere across the world, including Tylenol, Band-Aid, and Listerine. The company did see declines in the fourth quarter of 2020 because of the global COVID-19 pandemic, but it remains hopeful that its vaccine and the ease of restrictions will help it continue to grow moving forward.\nDisclosure: The author held no positions in the aforementioned securities at the time of publication.Do you have a news tip for Investopedia reporters?

Johnson & Johnson Long-Term Chart (2005 \u2013 2020) TradingView.com\u00a0 A multi-year uptrend topped out near $70 in 2005, marking a resistance level that denied progress until a 2013 breakout. The stock posted impressive gains into 2014 and sold off to a two-year low in 2015, ahead of a fresh breakout in May 2016. The rally topped out in the $140s in January 2018, giving way to a volatile period that has posted slightly higher highs and slightly lower lows. In turn, this has generated a bearish broadening formation, better known as a megaphone pattern.\nTipA broadening formation is a price chart pattern identified by technical analysts. It is characterized by increasing price\u00a0volatility\u00a0and diagrammed as two diverging trendlines: one rising and one falling.

The stock recouped its losses into April, but OBV barely budged, exposing weak interest that set off a major bearish divergence when price lifted to an all-time high on April 23. The rally then failed while the indicator drifted into a sideways pattern that still hasn't mounted the midpoint of the first quarter swoon.\n Price action since April has carved the outline of a potential symmetrical triangle that is now engaged in a fourth wave. A rally above $156 would improve the technical outlook in this configuration, but a downdraft looks more likely because this pattern usually draws five waves before ejecting into a new trend, higher or lower.

{"url": "https://www.investopedia.com/articles/technical/073001.asp", "title": "What Is the Stochastic Oscillator and How Is It Used?", "text": " The stochastic oscillator is one of the most relied-upon tools in technical analysis, ranking alongside popular indicators like the relative strength index (RSI) and moving average convergence/divergence (MACD).\n Developed by George Lane in the 1950s, this momentum indicator helps traders identify potential market reversals by comparing a security's closing price to its price range over a given period. Like a thermometer measuring market temperature, it signals when assets may be running too hot (overbought) or too cold (oversold).\n The indicator's power lies in the idea upon which it's based: Momentum changes often precede price changes. When a stock is trending upward, it tends to close near the high of its range, while during downtrends, it typically closes near the low of its range. The stochastic oscillator captures these patterns through two key measurements: %K, which tracks the current price position, and %D, which smooths out the data to filter market noise. Often combined with other tools, such as moving averages or pivot levels, the stochastic oscillator is adaptable to various asset classes and time frames, making it useful for short-term and long-term trading strategies.\nKey TakeawaysThe stochastic oscillator compares a security's closing price to its recent high-low range to identify momentum shifts.Readings above 80 indicate overbought conditions, while readings below 20 suggest oversold conditions.Traders use %K and %D crossovers to generate buy and sell signals, with bullish crossovers indicating potential buys and bearish crossovers indicating potential sells.Divergence between price action and the stochastic oscillator can signal potential trend reversals.The stochastic oscillator can be more effective in range-bound markets and may generate false signals in strong trends. History and Development  Lane's innovation centered on a simple but crucial observation: Just as a ball that is thrown straight up in the air slows before it reverses direction and comes back down, momentum in a security shifts before price changes direction. In trading, this can help you identify overbought (poised to fall in price) or oversold (poised to rise) assets.\n The tool was designed to gauge how closely a security's closing price is to its high or low over a specific period. In addition, the stochastic oscillator can foreshadow reversals when it shows bullish or bearish divergence. This signal is the first\u2014and arguably the most important\u2014trading signal Lane identified.\n Lane's contribution led to the evolution of the stochastic oscillator through multiple variants, including fast and slow versions, each offering different sensitivity levels to price changes. The stochastic oscillator has become a core tool in modern technical analysis. It's often used to confirm trends, spot divergences between price and momentum, and anticipate potential reversals.\n Understanding the Stochastic Oscillator  The oscillator consists of two lines: the %K line, which measures the position of the current close within the range, and the %D line, a three-period moving average of the %K that acts as a signal line. Readings above 80 suggest that the asset may be overbought and due for a pullback or correction, while readings below 20 indicate it may be oversold and poised for a rebound. Traders look for crossovers between the %K and %D lines as buy or sell signals, with those in oversold or overbought zones being particularly strong indicators of momentum shifts.ImportantThe stochastic indicator is classified as an oscillator, a term used in technical analysis to describe a tool that creates bands around a mean. The idea is that price action will tend to be bound by the bands and revert to the mean over time. Divergence between the price and the oscillator can signal trend reversals. But divergence shouldn't be used in isolation. Experienced traders tend to use it only with other technical analysis tools to make signal generation more reliable. How the Stochastic Oscillator Is Calculated  The oscillator is calculated using two main formulas, one for the %K line and another for the %D line. The %K line is the primary component of the stochastic oscillator, and the %D line acts as a smoothed moving average of the %K line.\n The %K formula is as follows: %K = (C - Ln ) / (Hn - Ln ) \u00d7 100\n Where:\nC = Current closeLn = Lowest low over the past n periodsHn = Highest high over the past n periods %K oscillates between 0 and 100, where a higher %K indicates that the closing price is near the highest point of the recent period, and a lower %K indicates it is near the lowest point.\n The %D is merely a three-period simple moving average of %K. %D is a smoother, stabler line than %K, which helps traders filter out noise and spot trends more effectively.Fast Fact%K is sometimes called the\u00a0fast stochastic\u00a0indicator, while the slow stochastic is %D, calculated as the three-period moving average of %K. Using the Stochastic Oscillator in Trading  Traders commonly use stochastic oscillators to detect extreme conditions in security prices in anticipation of potential market reversals or consolidations. A reading above 80 alerts traders to a possibly overbought market ripe for pullback, while readings below 20 indicate an oversold market poised for a rebound.\n Traders look for %K and %D crossovers to generate signals. A bullish crossover, when the %K crosses above the %D in oversold territory, can indicate a buying prospect, while a bearish crossover, when the %K crosses below %D in overbought territory, suggests that it is time to sell short.\n Divergence between the stochastic oscillator and price action can also signal potential reversals. A bullish divergence occurs when the price hits a lower low, but the oscillator makes a higher low, indicating weakening downward momentum and a possible reversal to the upside. Conversely, a bearish divergence occurs when a security's price hits a higher high, but the oscillator forms a lower high, indicating a loss of upward momentum and a possible impending price drop. To improve the accuracy of the stochastic oscillator's signals, many traders combine it with moving averages, support and resistance levels, and trend lines to avoid false signals. The oscillator's sensitivity can also be adjusted by changing its time frame, with shorter periods providing faster but noisier signals and longer periods smoothing out fluctuations for more reliable but slower signals.\n Practical Applications and Example JNJ Stochastic Oscillator Strategy.Tradingview Traders can use the stochastic oscillator as shown in the chart above. The strategy depicted combines signals from the stochastic oscillator and the volume-weighted average price (VWAP) to generate buy and sell signals based on momentum and trend alignment on the stock Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) with a four-hour chart.\n The strategy defines three buy conditions:\nCondition 1: %K crosses above %D while %K and %D are below 20, and the closing price is above the VWAPCondition 2: %K and %D are above 50 but below 80, and the closing price crosses above the VWAPCondition 3: %K crosses above %D, but %K and %D are below 80, and the closing price is above the VWAP Similarly, the three sell conditions are as follows:\nCondition 1: %K crosses below %D while %K and %D are above 80, and the closing price is below the VWAPCondition 2: %K and %D are below 50 but above 20, and the closing price crosses below the VWAPCondition 3: %K crosses below %D, but %K and %D are above 20, and the closing price is below the VWAP When trading, the strategy is to enter long positions when any buy condition is met and short positions when any sell condition is met. It closes any opposing positions and uses additional exit criteria based on price crossing VWAP or stochastic signals reversing.\n This approach effectively combines momentum signals of the %K and %D crossovers with VWAP to confirm trend direction, reducing the likelihood of false signals by ensuring trades align with momentum shifts and price trends.\n In addition, by setting specific conditions for both overbought and oversold levels and prices relative to the VWAP, the strategy ensures that entries are only made when there is strong confirmation of a reversal or continuation while using VWAP as an additional filter to exit trades if the trend changes.\n This multilayered and practical approach can help traders capture short-term prospects while minimizing risk in volatile markets.\n Benefits and Limitations of the Stochastic Oscillator  Like any tool, the stochastic oscillator has both benefits and limitations.BenefitsSimplicity: The indicator is relatively easy to interpret. With values ranging from 0 to 100, traders can quickly identify overbought and oversold conditions. A reading above 80 indicates an asset is overbought, while a reading below 20 suggests oversold.Overbought and oversold identification: The tool is handy for identifying market conditions where a price may be poised for a reversal.Effective in range-bound markets: Traders can use the stochastic oscillator to take advantage of prices bouncing between support and resistance levels.Detects divergence: Divergence between the stochastic oscillator and the price can provide early signals of potential trend reversals.Indicator combination: Traders can use the oscillator with other technical indicators, such as moving averages, to increase the reliability of trading signals.Limitations Less effective with strong trends: The stochastic oscillator tends to generate false signals in strong trends. In uptrends, the oscillator may show overbought conditions for extended periods, but prices can continue to rise. Similarly, in downtrends, the oscillator may show oversold conditions, though prices might continue to fall.Lagging indicator: Considering that historical price data is used, the stochastic oscillator is a lagging indicator.Whipsaws: In volatile or choppy markets, the indicator can produce frequent whipsaws that generate false buy or sell signals.Subject to interpretation: Context is required to use the stochastic oscillator, and its signals should not be used in isolation. Additional confirmation from other indicators or chart patterns is usually called for.How Does the Stochastic Oscillator Differ From Other Momentum Oscillators?The difference is in how the stochastic oscillator calculates momentum and generates signals. The stochastic compares the closing price to the high-low range. The RSI, for example, measures the speed of price changes, while the commodity channel index measures deviations from the mean within a wider range.What's the Best Way To Combine the Stochastic Oscillator With Other Indicators?To reduce false signals, traders often pair the stochastic oscillator with trend indicators like moving averages or the average directional index to establish directional bias and confirm whether to prioritize buy or sell signals.Using support and resistance levels can help confirm reversals, while combining with momentum indicators like MACD or RSI filters out weaker signals, especially when both indicators show overbought or oversold conditions.In addition using volume indicators like on-balance volume can validate the strength of signals such as momentum divergence. Adjusting time frames can also allow traders to align short-term entries with long-term trends, providing more precision.How Do Traders Adjust the Stochastic Oscillator Settings for Different Assets?To improve signal accuracy, traders adjust the oscillator settings based on volatility, liquidity, and other characteristics of the market. For volatile assets like cryptocurrencies, commodities, and certain forex pairs, shorter settings like five to nine periods generate faster signals, making them suitable for day trading or scalping but with a higher risk of false signals.In contrast, longer settings (21 to 28) are preferred for stable assets like blue chip stocks or major indexes, where filtering out short-term noise is required for trend-following strategies. The default 14-period setting strikes a balance for most assets, making it ideal for swing trading and range-bound markets, but customizing the time frame based on asset behavior and trading strategy ensures better alignment with market dynamics. The Bottom Line  The stochastic oscillator is a momentum indicator that compares a security's closing price to its price range over a specific period, to identify overbought and oversold conditions. It consists of two primary lines, %K and %D, and traders use it to generate buy and sell signals, detect momentum shifts, and confirm potential trend reversals through crossovers and divergence with price action.\n While versatile and effective in range-bound markets, the indicator's performance can be improved by combining it with other technical indicators like moving averages, trend lines, or volume indicators to reduce false signals. Traders often adjust its settings based on the asset, volatility, and time frame to improve its accuracy.", "tags": ["www.investopedia.com", "articles", "wwwinvestopediacom"]}
{"url": "https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/split-off.asp", "title": "Split-Off: What it is, How it Works, Examples", "text": " What Is a Split-Off?  A split-off is a corporate reorganization method in which a parent company divests a business unit using specific structured terms. There can be several methods for structuring a divestiture. Split-offs, spinoffs, and carveouts are a few options, each with its own structuring.\n In a split-off, the parent company offers shareholders the option to keep their current shares or exchange them for shares of the divesting company. Shares outstanding are not proportioned on a pro rata basis like in other divestitures. In some split-offs, the parent company may choose to offer a premium for the exchange of shares to promote interest in shares of the new company.\nKey TakeawaysSplit-offs are a method that can be used for a corporate divestiture.Split-offs do not mandate a proportioned pro rata share distribution but rather offer shareholders the option to exchange shares.Split-offs are motivated by the desire to create greater value for shareholders through the shedding of assets and offering of a new, separate company. Understanding Split-Offs  A split-off is a type of business reorganization method that is fueled by the same motivations of all divestitures in general. The main difference in a split off vs. other divestiture methods is the distribution of shares.\n Businesses enacting a split-off must generally follow Internal Revenue practices for a Type D reorganization pursuant to Internal Revenue Code, Sections 368 and 355. Following these codes allow for a tax-free transaction primarily because shares are exchanged which is a tax-free event. In general, a Type D split-off also involves the transferring of assets from the parent company to the newly organized company.\nImportantSplit-offs are generally characterized as a Type D reorganization which requires adherence to Internal Revenue Code, Sections 368 and 355. A split-off includes the option for current shareholders of the parent company to exchange their shares for new shares in the new company. Shareholders do not have to exchange any shares since there is no proportional pro rata share exchange involved. Oftentimes, the parent company will offer a premium in the exchange of current shares to the newly organized company\u2019s shares to create interest and offer an incentive in the share exchange.\n Example of a Split-Off  In 2023, Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) announced the split-off of its Consumer Health business, which would thereafter be a separate public company called Kenvue. According to CEO Joaquin Duato, the separation \"further sharpens Johnson & Johnson's focus\" on pharmaceuticals and medical technology, while bringing greater value to shareholders.\n Under the terms of the split-off, investors were given the option of trading \"some, all, or none of their shares\" of JNJ common stock with Kenvue (KVUE) common stock. Participating JNJ shareholders received a 7% discount on the exchange, allowing them to receive up to 8.0549 shares of Kenvue stock for each share of JNJ stock. The deal was oversubscribed, meaning that not all JNJ shareholders were able to exchange their stock for KVUE shares. The split-off was preceded by an initial public offering, where about 10% of Kenvue's shares were sold to the public. Net proceeds from the sale were given to Johnson & Johnson in partial consideration for the split-off.What Is the Difference Between a Split-Off and a Spin-Off?A split-off is similar to a spin-off, in that both involve a parent company separating from a subsidiary. The difference is in how shares are distributed: in a spin-off, shareholders receive shares of both the parent company and the former subsidiary. In a split-off, shareholders must choose whether they want to receive shares of the old parent company, or the new company.What Is a Split-Off Transaction?A split-off transaction is a transaction where a parent entity divests itself from a former subsidiary, which becomes a new company. Shareholders in the parent entity are given the opportunity to exchange some (or all) of their shares in the parent entity for shares of the new company. This option may be important if shareholders have a strong preference for one company over the other.What Is the Difference Between a Split-Off and a Carve-Out?A carve-out is another form of offering where a subsidiary is turned into a new public company. In a carve-out, the parent company sells shares to the public in an initial public offering. A carve-out can sometimes be the first step before a spin-off or split-off, allowing the new company to raise capital as well. The Bottom Line  A split-off is a type of exit strategy where part of a company is reorganized into a new public company. Shareholders in the old company are given the chance of exchanging their shares for stock in the new company.", "tags": ["www.investopedia.com", "terms", "wwwinvestopediacom"]}

Some companies such as Alphabet have issued multiple classes of shares. The top 10 largest holdings are listed on the official S&P Global website. An S&P 500 company must meet specific requirements to be included as a constituent within the index.\n S&P doesn't provide the total list of holdings, however, at least not for free. Subscribers to S&P's research unit, Capital IQ, can get access to the entire list. S&P 500 companies represent the top companies within their industries and they're a gauge of U.S. economic activity.Key TakeawaysThe S&P 500 includes some of the top companies that are leaders within their industries and represent a gauge of the U.S. economy.Companies must meet certain requirement criteria determined by the publishers of the index before being added to the S&P.The S&P 500 index is market capitalization-weighted so it gives a higher percentage allocation to companies with the largest market cap.A stock must meet certain criteria including a total market cap of $14.5 billion to join the S&P 500.Companies can be removed from the S&P 500 if they deviate substantially from these standards. S&P 500 Inclusion Criteria  The S&P 500 was created in 1957 and it's one of the most widely quoted stock market indexes. S&P 500 stocks represent the largest publicly traded companies in the U.S. The S&P 500 focuses on the U.S. market's large-cap sector. An S&P 500 company must meet a broad set of criteria to be added to the index:\nIt must have a total market capitalization of at least $14.5 billion.Must be a U.S. companyA float-adjusted liquidity ratio (FALR) greater than or equal to 0.75A positive sum of the most recent four consecutive quarters of trailing earningsPositive earnings for its most recent quarterMust meet certain liquidity requirements Companies may be removed from the S&P 500 if they deviate substantially from these standards.$53.7 TrillionThe total combined market cap of the 504 constituents in the S&P 500 as of Feb. 25, 2025. S&P 500 Calculation  The S&P 500 is a free-float market capitalization-weighted index. Market capitalization represents the total dollar market value of a company's outstanding equity shares. Market cap is calculated by multiplying the total number of outstanding shares of stock by the company's current stock price. A company with 20 million shares outstanding in which its stock is selling for $100 per share would have a market cap of $2 billion. The more valuable an individual company's stock becomes, the more it contributes to the S&P 500's overall return as a result. It's not uncommon for three-quarters of the index's return to be linked to only 50 to 75 stocks.\n The addition or subtraction of smaller companies from the index therefore doesn't have a noticeable impact on the overall return of the index. The removal or addition of even just one of the largest stocks can have a major effect, however.\n S&P 500 Sector Breakdown  These are the top sectors and their weightings within the S&P 500 index as of Feb. 25, 2025.S&P 500 Sector Weighting\u00a0SectorIndex WeightingInformation Technology30.7%Financials14.1%Consumer Discretionary11.4%Healthcare10.5%Communication Services9.9%Industrials8.3%Consumer Staples\u00a05.5%Energy3.1%Utilities2.3%Real Estate2.1%Materials1.9%Source: S&P Dow Jones Indices\n\n Being aware of the S&P's sector weighting is important because sectors with a smaller weighting may not have a material impact on the value of the overall index. This can be the case even if they're outperforming or underperforming the market.\n If oil prices are rising and leading to increased profits for the energy sector, those stocks represent only 4.4% of the S&P 500. Oil stocks may not lead to a higher S&P if the more heavily weighted information technology sector is underperforming.\nImportantS&P 500 components are weighted by free-float market capitalization so larger companies can affect the value of the index to a greater degree. Top 25 Components by Market Cap  The exact weightings of the top 25 components aren't available from S&P directly so the weightings below are from the SPDR S&P 500 Trust ETF (SPY). SPY is the oldest exchange-traded fund (ETF) that tracks the S&P 500. It holds $625.5 billion in assets under management (AUM) as of Feb. 25, 2025 and is highly traded.

{"url": "https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/what-is-a-drip/", "title": "What Is a DRIP Investment? Plus How It Works and Its Benefits", "text": " For investors seeking steady wealth-building rather than get-rich-quick schemes, dividend reinvestment plans (DRIPs) offer a methodical approach to growing investments over time. They come with built-in compounding that can greatly increase the size of your portfolio over the years and decades.\n Many trading experts, including Yvan Byeajee, author of \"Trading Composure: Mastering Your Mind for Trading Success,\" argue that DRIPs can be a great part of a systematic approach that long-term investors need to succeed.\n \"Investing is about building wealth steadily over time. The key phrase is 'over time,'\" Byeajee told Investopedia. \"Sustainable investing is about playing the long game, respecting the process, and allowing compounding to work its magic over time.\" DRIPs embody this philosophy by automatically reinvesting cash dividends to buy additional shares of a company's stock.\nKey TakeawaysMost investment experts and financial advisors suggest that most people benefit from a systematic, long-term way to build up their portfolios.A DRIP is one of these. It's a dividend reinvestment plan through which cash dividends are reinvested to buy more stock.DRIPs use dollar-cost averaging (DCA), which is intended to average the price at which you buy stock as it moves up or down.DRIPs help investors accumulate additional shares at a lower cost since there are no commissions or brokerage fees. Most major publicly traded companies like Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), The Coca-Cola Company (KO), and Procter & Gamble (PG) offer DRIPs either directly or through brokerage firms. These plans give investors a low-cost way to steadily increase their holdings without paying commissions or fees on reinvested dividends. DRIPs also help remove emotion from investing decisions since the reinvestment happens automatically, no matter the market conditions.\n How DRIPs\u00a0Work  A dividend is a reward to shareholders\u2014often in the form of a cash payment via direct deposit. DRIPs allow investors the choice of reinvesting that cash in more shares of the company's stock.\n Many brokers allow you to reinvest dividends in the underlying securities through DRIP programs. However, you can also enroll in DRIPs directly with the company through direct stock purchase plans.\n How Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) Works With DRIPs  \"For most people in most situations, a long-term, buy-and-hold, diversified, low-cost investment approach is likely more suitable than active trading,\" said David Tenerelli, a certified financial planner at Values Added Financial in Plano, Texas. \"This is because it helps the investor ignore the 'noise' and instead focus on a disciplined approach.\"\n Tenerelli explained that one such strategy for long-term investing is dollar-cost averaging (DCA)\u2014putting a set amount away periodically, no matter what. \"It takes discipline to continue to buy investments during a market downturn, but a shift in mindset can help\u2014rather than fearing financial loss, an investor can reframe it as buying stocks 'on sale,'\" he said.\n DCA is a key feature of DRIPs. With DRIPs, your dividends automatically buy more shares when prices are low and fewer shares when prices are high. This means the dividends being reinvested are doing the work that most people with DCA strategies do by putting away a set amount of cash in an investment each pay period.\n For example, suppose you receive a $100 quarterly dividend from a company. If the stock price is $50, your DRIP would buy two shares. But if the stock price drops to $25, that same $100 dividend would buy four shares. This automatic adjustment helps cut the risk of investing all your money when prices are at their peak and thus getting fewer shares in the long run.\n Thus, the upshot of using DCA in DRIP programs is that it turns market volatility from your enemy into an ally, automatically buying more shares when prices dip.ImportantExperts like Byeajee and Tenerelli advise combining DCA with DRIPs because it removes more of the emotional element from investing. \"It takes discipline to continue to buy investments during a market downturn,\" Tenerelli said. \"But a shift in mindset can help\u2014rather than fearing financial loss, an investor can reframe it as buying stocks 'on sale.'\" Types of DRIPs  Company-sponsored and brokerage-operated DRIPs offer different paths to reinvesting your dividends. Understanding the differences can help you choose the option that best fits your investment style and goals.\n Company-Sponsored DRIPs  These let you buy stock directly from companies like Coca-Cola or Johnson & Johnson, often at a discount of 3% to 5% below market price, our review of such plans available online showed. DRIPs typically let you start with a small investment\u2014sometimes buying even one share\u2014and then make additional purchases over time.\n Many companies go out of their way to make such plans seem like you're joining a special club where you get special perks\u2014which you do, including discounted shares and zero commission fees.\n But why do companies do this? Simple: They get investment dollars or capital from shareholders, which they can use to reinvest and grow the company. In addition, investorswho are part of a company's DRIP program are believed to be less likely to sell their shares if the company has one bad earnings report or if the overall market declines.\n Brokerage DRIPs  Brokerage DRIPs work differently. If you already have an account with Fidelity, Charles Schwab, etc., you can typically enroll any dividend-paying stocks you own in their DRIP program. While you won't get the company discount, these plans offer more flexibility since you can easily manage all your investments in one place and quickly turn the DRIP feature on or off for different stocks.\n Most investors start with brokerage DRIPs because they're convenient and don't require setting up separate accounts with each company. However, if you plan to invest regularly in a specific company over many years, a company-sponsored DRIP will save you more money in the long run.\n The Benefits of Using DRIPs  Beyond automatic reinvestment, DRIPs offer several advantages that make them attractive for long-term investors. The most obvious benefit is the 3%-to-5% discount we mentioned above.\n But DRIPs also help enforce investment discipline. When dividends are used to automatically buy more shares, you're less likely to spend that money elsewhere.\n Perhaps most importantly, DRIPs harness the power of compounding. Each reinvested dividend buys more shares, which then generate larger dividend payments, which then buy even more shares. Over time, this snowball effect can significantly increase your total returns.\n Potential Drawbacks to DRIPs  While DRIPs offer many benefits, they're not right for everyone.\n Math With Fractions  Since dividends are typically less than the price of company shares, you'll be buying fractional shares over time. For example, let's say that Company X pays a $10 dividend on a stock that traded at $100 per share. Every time there's a dividend, those within the DRIP plan would receive one-tenth of a\u00a0share.\n Since you're buying fractional shares at different prices over time, calculating your cost basis for taxes can become complicated\u2014imagine tracking hundreds of tiny purchases over many years. That said, whether you use a DRIP through the company or your brokerage, your DRIP account will likely take care of this, keeping detailed records of your share ownership percentages for you. You'll Need Patience  DRIPs also require patience and a long-term perspective. This is because, even if something comes up that requires you to sell your shares quickly, company-sponsored DRIPs can slow this process down since you typically must sell through the company rather than through a broker.\n Diversification  In addition, too much of a focus on dividend-paying stocks might lead to a less diversified portfolio. Not all great companies pay dividends\u2014for example, many growth stocks like technology companies reinvest their profits rather than paying dividends.\n The problem becomes even more acute if you use company-sponsored DRIPs since you might limit yourself just to one or two companies, putting a far greater part of your portfolio in just one part of the market.\n Tax Implications of DRIPs  Even though you're reinvesting rather than receiving dividends in cash, the IRS still considers the dividends as taxable income in the year they're paid out. Just like if you take your paycheck and put it right into a savings account, you still owe taxes on that income even if you never touch the money.\n For regular dividend-paying stocks held in taxable accounts, these dividends are typically counted as qualified dividends, which are taxed at lower long-term capital gains rates rather than as ordinary income. However, you'll need to meet certain holding period requirements to qualify for these lower rates. In addition, when you eventually sell the DRIP shares, you'll owe capital gains taxes on any appreciation in share value. This is where good record-keeping becomes crucial\u2014you'll need to know your cost basis (purchase price) for all those shares bought through your DRIP over the years.\nCan I Participate in DRIPs If I Buy Stocks Through My Individual Retirement Account (IRA)?Yes, you can enroll stocks held in IRAs and other retirement accounts in DRIPs. One advantage of reinvesting dividends in retirement accounts is that you won't face any immediate tax consequences on the dividends, unlike in taxable accounts.However, any dividends automatically reinvested still count toward your required minimum distributions once you reach the age when these become mandatory.What Happens to My DRIP Investments If the Company is Acquired or Merges With Another?There are a couple of possibilities. If the acquiring company has a DRIP, your enrollment might transfer to the new company's plan. In cash buyouts, your DRIP typically ends and you receive cash for your shares. In stock-for-stock deals, your shares usually convert to the shares of the acquiring company. It's important to read all communications from the company during these transitions since you may need to decide what happens to your DRIP account.How Do Stock Splits Affect DRIPs?When a company splits its stock, your DRIP should shift over seamlessly. For example, in a two-for-one split, you'll now own twice as many shares at half the price, but the total value of your account will be the same.Future dividend reinvestments will simply buy shares at the new split-adjusted prices. The main impact is that you might be able to buy more whole shares with each reinvestment since the share price is lower.When Is a DRIP Not the Best Choice?DRIPs might not suit investors who rely on dividends for income since reinvesting them takes away the cash you might need to be available. In addition, investors focused on maintaining a diversified portfolio may find DRIPs concentrate their investments too heavily on a single stock or handful of stocks. In these cases, manually reinvesting dividends in other securities might be more appropriate. The Bottom Line  DRIPs offer a great way to build a portfolio over time, especially if you get a discount on the shares along with the effects of compounding. While DRIPS require patience and careful record-keeping, the potential long-term benefits often outweigh these challenges.\n Just remember to consider both the advantages and limitations of these plans in the context of your overall investment strategy, risk tolerance, and tax situation.\n", "tags": ["www.investopedia.com", "ask", "wwwinvestopediacom"]}

Yet for many people, the world of investing is still mysterious, with unfamiliar terms and concepts.\n The good news is that successful investing doesn't require advanced math skills or complex strategies. Instead, it starts with understanding the basic building blocks of investing\u2014known as asset classes\u2014and how they fit together. From the relative safety of a savings account to the growth potential of stocks, each type has different potentials for risk and rewards.\n Understanding where these different assets stand on the investment risk ladder can give you a solid foundation for getting started in investing. We'll take you through this below.\nKey TakeawaysGiven the wide variety of available assets, investing can be daunting for beginners.Every investment sits somewhere on the risk ladder, with cash being the safest but lowest-returning option and alternative investments typically being the riskiest but with the potential for the highest returns.Sticking with index funds or exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that mirror the market is often the best path for a newer investor.The stock market has historically delivered higher returns than bonds over long periods, but it has had greater short-term risks and far wider price swings.Investment experts recommend spreading money across different types of investments (diversification) rather than putting everything into one category.Investopedia / Joules Garcia Understanding the Investment Risk Ladder  Here are the major asset classes, in order of ascending risk, on the investment risk ladder.\n Cash  A bank deposit is the safest and easiest investment asset to understand\u2014it's also usually the first one we have. It not only gives investors a detailed account of the interest that they'll earn but also guarantees that they\u2019ll get their capital back. On the downside, the interest earned from cash socked away in a savings account seldom beats inflation.\n Certificates of deposit (CDs) are less liquid, but they typically provide higher interest rates than those in savings accounts. However, the money put into a CD is locked up for some time (months to years), and usually come with penalties for early withdrawal.TipFinancial advisors often start off with clients suggesting they plan for the long haul. \"For most people in most situations, a long-term, buy-and-hold, diversified, low-cost investment approach is likely more suitable than active trading,\" David Tenerelli, a certified financial planner in Plano, Texas, told Investopedia. \"This is because it helps the investor ignore the 'noise' and instead focus on a disciplined approach.\" Bonds  A bond is a debt instrument representing a loan made by an investor to a borrower. A typical bond will involve either a corporation or government, where the borrower will issue a fixed interest rate to the buyer of the bond in exchange for using their capital. U.S. Treasurys are the most popular bonds the world over. Bond rates are essentially determined by central bank interest rates. Because of this, they are heavily traded when the U.S. Federal Reserve\u2014or other central banks\u2014raise rates. Mutual Funds  A mutual fund is a big investment pool where many people put their money together and hand it to a professional money manager that buys stocks, bonds, or other investments on their behalf. In return, you get shares proportional to how much you put in for the immense pool of assets.\n These funds take investors with as little as $500 to start, and many have no minimum. Even with a modest investment, you can own pieces of hundreds of different companies. For example, if you invest $1,000 in a mutual fund with 100 different stocks, it's like buying small slices of all those companies simultaneously.\n Some mutual funds are designed to copy popular indexes like the S&P 500\u2014the first mutual funds in the 1970s did exactly this. These are called \"passive\" funds since the managers are just trying to match a specific index, which takes far less effort than trying to beat the market.\n Other mutual funds are actively managed, meaning investment professionals try to beat the market by constantly adjusting their investments (like a chef experimenting with ingredients). However, these actively managed funds typically charge higher fees, which can eat into your returns over time.\n Unlike stocks, which you can buy and sell throughout the day, mutual fund trades only happen once per day after the market closes. The price you pay or receive is based on something called the net asset value\u2014essentially the value of the entire investment pool\u2014which is calculated at the end of each trading day.TipThe most difficult time for any investor is watching a market enter a period of turmoil. \"I make a point to discuss past market experiences and potential market volatility,\" Alyson Basso, managing principal of Hayden Wealth Management in Middleton, Massachusetts, told Investopedia. That way, clients are mentally prepared. But investors can help themselves by preparing ahead. \"I also remind them that diversified investing helps spread out risk, so they're not putting all their eggs in one basket.\" Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have grown significantly in popularity since their introduction in the early 1990s. ETFs are like mutual funds but trade throughout the day on a stock exchange. So, you can trade them just like shares of Apple Inc. (AAPL). This also means that their value rises and falls as the trading day goes on. ETFs can mirror an underlying index such as the Dow Jones Industrial Average or any other basket of stocks an ETF manager chooses. The index might cover anything from emerging markets to commodities, individual business sectors such as biotechnology or agriculture, and more, though the most popular, for both mammoth institutional investors and those putting a bit into a fund each paycheck, remains those that track indexes. Stocks  When you buy a stock, you're buying a tiny piece of ownership in a company. If you own Apple stock, for example, you really are a part-owner of the company\u2014even if it's just a modest amount.\n There are two main ways to make money from stocks:\nThe share price goes up after you buy it: First, when other investors like what they see with the company and like the price offered to buy shares, they'll buy the stock. If enough do this, the share price will go up. When it does, you can sell your shares\u2014the amount above what you paid for them is called price appreciation\u2014to net a capital gain.\nDividends: Second, some companies share their profits directly with stockholders through regular payments called dividends.\n Companies that have provided dividends for 25 straight years are known as dividend aristocrats. Below is a list of those in the S&P 500 index.\n However, stocks come with real risks. Companies can lose money, stock prices can fall below what you paid, and in the worst case\u2014if a company goes bankrupt\u2014stockholders are last in line to get any money back. That's why financial advisors often suggest not investing money in stocks that you'll need within the next five years.\n But you can lower your risk by choosing certain types of stocks. Large, established companies like Coca-Cola Inc. (KO) or Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) typically offer more stable but slower growth. Midsized companies offer a middle ground, while small companies, called small-caps, are capable of explosive growth but also more likely to stumble.\n The riskiest stocks often come from young companies in emerging industries or those in financial trouble, nicknamed \"penny stocks\" when they trade for less than $5 per share.Fast FactSome investments, such as hedge funds, are restricted to wealthy investors. Alternative Investments  There is a vast universe of so-called alternative investments that aren't stocks, bonds, or funds that collect them:\nReal estate: You can invest in property two ways. The direct approach involves buying actual buildings or land\u2014if you've bought a home, you know the effort involved. The easier route is buying shares in Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs)\u2014companies that own and manage properties. REITs trade like stocks but must pay out 90% of their profits each year to investors, often resulting in higher dividends.Hedge funds and private equity: These investment vehicles are like exclusive clubs\u2014they're typically only open to those with wealth already (called \"accredited investors\"). Hedge funds try to make money whether markets go up or down, using complex strategies. Private equity firms buy entire companies, change their structure, and then sell them for a profit. Both usually require investors to lock up their money for years.Commodities: These are physical goods like gold, crude oil, or agricultural products. While you probably don't want a herd of cattle in your backyard, you can invest in commodities through special funds that track their prices. Many investors use commodities as a hedge or protection against inflation since their prices often rise when the cost of living increases. Some specialized ETFs are also designed to focus on commodities.TipOrder your copy of Investopedia's What To Do With $10,000 magazine for more wealth-building advice. How To Invest Sensibly, Suitably, and Simply  Starting your investment journey doesn't need to be complicated. Here's a straightforward approach:\nBegin with the basics: Start with mutual funds or ETFs that track broad market indexes. It's better when starting to buy slices of the entire market rather than trying to pick individual winners.Keep costs low: Every dollar you pay in fees is a dollar that's not growing in your account. Index funds typically charge lower fees than actively managed investments.Diversify gradually: As you get more comfortable checking in on your portfolio\u2014you'll start off getting a bit freaked at each tick downward, but that goes away (mostly)\u2014you might add different types of investments. But don't feel pressured to own everything. Many successful investors stick with a simple mix of stock and bond index funds their entire lives. Remember Warren Buffett's advice: The world's most famous investor suggests most people would do well with just two funds\u2014one tracking the S&P 500 (U.S. stocks) and one tracking U.S. bonds.TipFor most people, the best portfolio is not the most complex one, but the one they'll stick with through market ups and downs. Setting Realistic Expectations for Assets in Any Economy  Just as different types of weather call for different clothes, various economic conditions tend to favor different investments. Here's how it generally works:\nWhen the Economy is StrongStocks usually do well during economic booms. It's clear why: When people have jobs and money to spend, companies make more profit, which often leads to higher stock prices.Bonds tend to struggle during these periods because rising interest rates (which often come with strong growth) make existing bonds worth less.Real estate often does well when the economy is humming, too, and people have good jobs. However, if interest rates rise too much, higher mortgage costs will cool the housing market.When the Economy Is Slowing DownStocks often take a hit as company profits fall and investors get nervous.However, bonds typically do better because interest rates typically drop during tough times, making existing bonds more valuable.Cash becomes more attractive to many investors during uncertain times. But you won't earn anything for it\u2014you don't earn interest or dividends from the cash stashed under your mattress.Special SituationsGold often acts like a financial fallout shelter. When investors get anxious\u2014whether from economic troubles, political uncertainty, or fears of inflation\u2014many rush to gold as a safe haven. For example, gold prices hit record highs during the uncertainty of the 2020 pandemic and have spiked to records several times since in light of political turmoil in hot spots across the world and other worries.Commodities like oil and metals tend to do well when inflation rises since their prices often increase along with everything else.Cash and cash-like investments, such as money market funds, attract investors looking to protect their money during uncertain times. While these won't generate big returns, they offer stability when other investments get choppy. Keep in mind: While these patterns tend to hold true over time, there are no guarantees they'll do so next time. That's why diversification\u2014spreading your money across different types of investments \u2014is crucial no matter the economic conditions.\nWhat Are the Different Asset Classes?Historically, the three main asset classes were equities (stocks), debt (bonds), and money market instruments. Today, you'd add real estate, commodities, futures, options, and even cryptocurrencies as separate asset classes.Which Asset Classes Are the Hardest to Trade?Generally, land and real estate are considered among the least liquid assets because buying or selling a property at market price often takes a long time. Money market instruments are the most liquid because they can easily be sold for their full value.What Asset Classes Are Best When Inflation Is High?Real estate and commodities are considered good inflation hedges because their value tends to rise as prices increase. In addition, some government bonds adjust automatically for inflation, making them an attractive way to store excess cash. The Bottom Line  Understanding the investment risk ladder, which moves from safe cash holdings at the bottom to volatile alternative investments at the top, gives you a good way to think about building your portfolio. You can start with simple, widely used investments like index funds that track the broad market. As your knowledge grows, you can explore other rungs that match your goals and risk tolerance.\n Remember three key principles: Never invest in something you don't understand, ignore \"hot tips\" from unreliable sources, and spread your money across different assets. And consider consulting only with fee-only financial advisors . They get paid for their time rather than for selling specific products, so their advice is more likely to put your interests first.\n", "tags": ["www.investopedia.com", "articles", "wwwinvestopediacom"]}

{"url": "https://www.investopedia.com/will-consumers-rescue-the-economy-again-amid-tariffs-11722448", "title": "Will Consumers Be Able to Rescue the Economy Again? ", "text": "Key TakeawaysConsumer sentiment is in the doldrums as shoppers worry tariffs will increase prices.Many economists have raised concerns that poor sentiment could slow consumer spending, hindering economic growth.However, the last time consumers felt this bad about the economy, their appetite for spending helped keep the economy out of recession, mainly due to a strong labor market. Consumers may have doubts about the economy's future, but that hasn't stopped them from spending so far\u2014a habit that could prevent a recession.\n Consumer sentiment fell for the fourth consecutive month in April. The declines reflect uncertainty surrounding President Donald Trump\u2019s tariff policies and whether they will drive up prices across the economy. Some forecasters are worried that the sour mood could translate to a sustained slowdown in spending and send the economy into a recession.\n \u201cHow consumers act in these next couple of months will be telling,\u201d wrote Wells Fargo economists Tim Quinlan and Shannon Grein.\u00a0 \u201cConsumer optimism has slid amid tariff-related pricing concerns, but one of the lessons of the pandemic was that what consumers say is seldom the best barometer for actual spending.\u201d\n What Does History Tell Us About Consumer Spending Amid a Dour Outlook?  Consumer sentiment was at a historically low reading of 50 in June 2022, when inflation was at more than 9% and gas prices approached $5 amid Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine.\n However, despite the poor sentiment over elevated inflation, retail sales grew that month, including higher restaurant spending. This was part of a longer trend of strong consumer spending that helped keep the economy from slipping into recession during that period.\u00a0\n A good job market kept consumers spending during that period of bad vibes, which economists said could help keep the economy moving during the current period of low sentiment.\n \"We actually saw spending be very solid, if not strong, over that period,\" said Nationwide's senior economist Ben Ayers. \"The sentiment readings were not looking so great, but the job numbers were very strong, and that gave people the income and the confidence that they could go out and spend money and that they would still have income coming in.\"\n To that end, economists saw good news in the April jobs report released on Friday, which showed better-than-expected job growth. However, there could be weakness ahead, as the weekly jobless claims reached their highest levels since February, said Bret Kenwell, a U.S. investment analyst at eToro.\n \"Although consumers have been shifting how they spend their money, they\u2019re still spending, and that can keep powering the U.S. economy forward,\" Kenwell said. \"However, that engine could stall if the labor market deteriorates.\"\n Spending Remains Solid But Weaknesses Are Emerging  Spending remains strong, at least for the time being.\n Retail sales, often used as an indicator of spending, came in better than economists projected in March, as Trump ramped up his tariff talk. Some attributed the jump to shoppers rushing to buy items before tariff costs hit, especially on cars, but other economists said consumer trends weren't so clear.\n \"What's difficult with looking at that data is trying to decide how much of that was just people buying things in advance of tariff price increases,\" Ayers said.\n Economists pointed out that restaurants and bars saw a 1.8% increase in sales in March, a spending category that isn't closely associated with imports.\n \u201cWe're not aware of a way you can front-run tariffs with a nice night out,\u201d the Wells Fargo economists wrote, noting that March\u2019s restaurant spending data was \u201ca key signal that while spending may be slowing, consumers have not gone into hiding when it comes to discretionary spending.\u201d\n However, there could be a slowdown in discretionary spending on the horizon. For example, several major airlines have pulled their guidance for upcoming earnings amid weakening demand for domestic flights. Comerica Bank Chief Economist Bill Adams said that is bad news in a consumer spending category that is often a bellwether.\n \u201cThis is a sign that flight bookings show consumers are not only talking down the economy like they did in 2022 and 2023, they\u2019re acting on their bad vibes, too,\u201d Adams said.\nDo you have a news tip for Investopedia reporters?

On May 3, 2025, 94-year-old Buffett gave them a clear answer, announcing that he intends to step down as CEO at the end of the year and plans to ask the Berkshire Hathaway board to replace him with Greg Abel. \"I think the time has arrived where Greg should become the chief executive officer of the company at year end,\" Buffett said during the company's annual meeting.\n Abel, 62,\u00a0joined the Berkshire Hathaway board in 2018 as vice chair of non-insurance operations. He has over 30 years of experience in various roles at Berkshire Hathaway Energy, including 10 years as CEO. \"I think the prospects of Berkshire will be better under Greg\u2019s management than mine,\" Buffett said at the 2025 meeting in Omaha, Neb.Key TakeawaysAt the Berkshire Hathaway 2025 annual meeting, Warren Buffett announced his intention to step down at the end of the year, saying he will ask the Berkshire Hathaway board to make Greg Abel CEO.Abel is currently Berkshire's vice chair of non-insurance business operations and the chair of subsidiary Berkshire Hathaway Energy.Abel has been at Berkshire since 2000, when the conglomerate bought an energy company he'd been running.Known as a low-key but hardworking dealmaker, Abel has spearheaded some of Berkshire's biggest and most successful acquisitions. The first indication that Abel would become CEO came at the Berkshire Hathaway shareholder meeting in 2021, when then-executive vice chair of Berkshire Hathaway Charlie Munger made an offhand comment indicating that Abel would succeed Buffett. Buffett then confirmed the news in a CNBC interview the following Monday. \"Greg will keep the culture,\" Munger said at the time, discussing Berkshire's decentralized operating structure. Abel had long been considered one of the front-running heirs apparent for CEO, along with his fellow board member Ajit Jain, vice chair of insurance operations. In 2023, Buffett and Munger reaffirmed Abel's place in the company and said they were \"100% confident\" in their decision. \"Greg understands capital allocation as well as I do. That\u2019s lucky for us,\" Buffett said at the meeting. \"He will make those decisions, I think, very much in the same framework as I would make them. We have laid out that framework now for 30 years.\" Let's meet the man who is poised to preside over one of the largest U.S. corporations in the post-Buffett era.\n Early Life and Education  Born on June 1, 1962, and raised in Edmonton, Canada, Gregory Abel graduated from the University of Alberta in 1984 with a commerce degree. He became an accountant and, after a stint with Big Four accounting firm PwC (PricewaterhouseCoopers), joined a small electricity company, CalEnergy, in 1992. In 1998, he rose to become president of the business, which expanded into a variety of energy operations, changing its name to MidAmerican Energy Holdings after one of the firms it acquired. Abel became part of Berkshire Hathaway when the conglomerate bought MidAmerican in 2000. The firm eventually was re-named Berkshire Hathaway Energy (BHE). Abel served as its chief executive officer from 2008 to 2018. He currently serves as its chair. With subsidiaries focused on coal, natural gas, hydroelectric, wind, solar, geothermal, and nuclear energy, BHE had nearly 24,000 employees and reported more than\u00a0$25.9 billion\u00a0in revenue for 2024. Notable Accomplishments  BHE has accounted for and been involved in some of Berkshire's largest acquisitions, including PacifiCorp in 2005, Nevada utility NV Energy in 2013, and Dominion Energy\u2019s pipeline business in 2020. Abel also nurtured Home Services, a small real estate brokerage that came with the purchase of another company. It's now one of Berkshire's most successful holdings. At both MidAmerican and Berkshire, Abel was mentored by David Sokol, who seemed a likely successor to Warren Buffett until his resignation from Berkshire in 2011. Sokol was singing Abel's praises to Buffett as early as 2007.\n$20 millionGreg Abel's compensation in 2023, according to Berkshire's SEC filings. Warren Buffett's Successor  Although he tended to avoid public appearances and shareholder meetings, Abel's reputation began to spread throughout the financial and business world, as did speculation about his role at a post-Buffett Berkshire. In September 2017, JP Morgan analyst Sarah DeWitt wrote in a note,\u00a0\u201cThe most likely successor in our view, who Warren Buffett regularly praises, is Greg Abel.\u201d\n Then, in 2018, came the move that marked Abel as a potential heir apparent: Buffett elevated and appointed Abel, along with Ajit Jain, to the Berkshire Hathaway board of directors, creating two new seats for them. Abel received his current title: Vice-Chair of Non-Insurance Business Operations. As such, Abel oversees all of Berkshire's railroad, auto utilities, manufacturing, and retail subsidiaries\u2014over 90 companies in all. All told, the non-insurance operations represent $150 billion in sales and comprise 250,000 employees.\n For some time, Jain and Abel were both seen as likely successors to Buffett\u2014in fact, some gave Jain the edge.\n It's possible that Abel's age\u2014he's over a decade younger than the 73-year-old Jain\u2014ultimately was the decisive factor in being named Buffett's successor.\n While at MidAmerican, Abel acquired a reputation as a superb dealmaker, leading and growing the company in more diversified directions through smart mergers and purchases, and managing the new acquisitions intelligently and efficiently. His handling of purchases of Enron's gas lines and of a British firm, Northern Electric, stood out in particular.\nImportantIn his 2014 letter to shareholders, Charlie Munger characterized Greg Abel and Ajit Jain as \"proven performers who would probably be under-described as 'world-class.' 'World-leading' would be the description I would choose. In some important ways, each is a better business executive than Buffett.\" Management Style  A resident of Des Moines, where Berkshire Energy is based, Abel leads a relatively low-key life, like Buffett. Although something of an insider's secret, he has stepped up public appearances in the last few years and has become a notable onstage presence at recent annual meetings. His answers to questions, especially about energy conservation and sustainability, went down well with analysts and shareholders.Fast FactHockey is one of Abel's passions. He played the sport as a boy and coaches his children's teams. He previously served on the Hockey Canada Foundation's Board of Directors.Who Is Warren Buffett\u2019s Successor?In 2021, Greg Abel, chair of Berkshire Hathaway Energy, was named as Warren Buffett's eventual successor. In 2025, Buffett announced that he would step down at the end of the year and would ask the Berkshire board to make Abel CEO.What Is Greg Abel's Net Worth?Greg Abel's net worth was estimated to be about $484 million in 2021.How Much Is Warren Buffett Worth?As of May 2025, Warren Buffett's net worth is estimated to be about $160.9 billion. The Bottom Line  Greg Abel will face challenges when he steps into the role of CEO of Berkshire Hathaway. An increasingly activist group of Berkshire shareholders is agitating for the company to spend more of its considerable cash reserves, to reduce its carbon footprint, and to promote diversity. All this, along with the fact that he's not Warren Buffett.\n But then, he won't be inheriting Buffett's exact role. The job Buffett did will probably be divvied up among various people. Abel would be the CEO of Berkshire, but Buffett's son, Howard, is expected to be named Berkshire's non-executive chairman.\n Jain seems likely to continue as vice chair of insurance operations, and his job could expand further. He has also been cited as next in line for CEO, should anything happen to Abel. Finally, there may well be a bigger role for Todd Combs and Ted Weschler.

A quarter of single investors said they didn't plan to retire alone, and more than a fifth said they were scared to do so. Those fears can start before retirement does, with nearly 20% of non-retired singles worried that they won't be able to retire at all.\n \u201cSingle investors are facing retirement challenges that their coupled counterparts are not, relying solely on their individual saving efforts compared to those with a second source of income from a partner,\u201d Rona Guymon, senior vice president of Nationwide Annuity Distribution, said in a news release.\n Nearly half of single investors surveyed by Nationwide said they expected to need up to $600,000 in retirement savings to feel comfortable about their future. Less than a quarter, however, said they had at least $250,000 saved, and less than a fifth said they had $500,000 or more.\n Nationwide said singles are less likely to have financial strategies to help them deal with market risk: Fewer singles than those with partners focused on portfolio diversification or assets less tied to markets, while those with partners were more likely to seek professional planning help.\n Some recent Investopedia coverage of suggestions for people planning to retire soon can be found here and here.Do you have a news tip for Investopedia reporters?

In particular, the Federal Reserve had been buying billions of dollars of bonds in response to the pandemic's economic pressures. This bond-buying policy is a major influencer of mortgage rates.\n But starting in November 2021, the Fed began tapering its bond purchases downward, making sizable reductions each month until reaching net zero in March 2022. Between that time and July 2023, the Fed aggressively raised the federal funds rate to fight decades-high inflation. While the fed funds rate can influence mortgage rates, it doesn't directly do so.

At their March 19 meeting, the Fed released its quarterly rate forecast, which showed that, at that time, the central bankers\u2019 median expectation for the rest of the year was just two quarter-point rate cuts.

While you may not reach this level of wealth overnight, there are a few ways to set yourself on the path to accumulating $1 billion over time.\n Here\u2019s how you can potentially become a billionaire in your lifetime with realistic investment strategies.\nKey TakeawaysIt\u2019s possible to amass $1 billion over time with disciplined investments and smart strategies.Simply relying on a wage without investing won\u2019t get you there, but using compound interest through investments can significantly shorten the timeline.The S&P 500 index fund has historically outperformed many billionaires, showing that anyone can potentially reach the $1 billion mark with consistent investing. Earning a Billion From Scratch  If you chase after a billion dollars solely with wages and no investments, you will have to work for a long time. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the average weekly earnings for a full-time worker in the United States was $1,192 per week in the fourth quarter of 2024. That comes out to $61,984 per year. Let\u2019s say you have a second income to cover living expenses and decide to stash your $61,984 annual income under your mattress and make your billion that way.\n You\u2019ll have to work and stash your paychecks for 16,134 years before you make your first billion.\nTipIn addition to lots of time, you\u2019ll need lots of space for your cash. A billion dollars in $100 bills will be stacked on 10 standard construction pallets, with each pallet being 48 inches by 40 inches. You can speed things up if you move your money to a bank savings account that pays the current national average interest rate of 0.41%. In that case, you will have saved $1,000,000,000 in 1,029 years. Compound interest is as powerful as they say!\n Saving for a Billion  Since compound interest is so helpful, consider moving your annual wages into a high-yield savings account or a certificate of deposit (CD). The annual percentage yields (APYs) for these fluctuate with the economy\u2019s health and the Federal Reserve\u2019s responses. We\u2019ll keep things simple and use the current best rates for a national high-yield savings account and a CD and assume those rates hold for the campaign\u2019s duration. (In reality, they\u2019ll go up and down, but it\u2019s hard to predict how much, especially over generations of economic activity.)\n Currently, the best jumbo CDs pay 4.55% in interest.

With your annual wage and that return, you\u2019ll amass a billion dollars in 149 years.\n Meanwhile, the best high-yield savings accounts pay 4.75% interest right now. You\u2019ll only have to wait 144 years for your billion at that rate.\n Investing for a Billion  Investing is your best bet for reaching the $1 billion mark in a reasonable amount of time.\u00a0A well-structured strategy, such as investing in an S&P 500 index fund (e.g., Fidelity's FXAIX), can provide the returns you need. Historically, the S&P 500 has outperformed many of the world\u2019s wealthiest individuals\u2014demonstrating that anyone can become a billionaire by following the same investing principles.\n You decide to invest your annual wages into an index fund and choose Fidelity\u2019s FXAIX, one of Investopedia\u2019s top funds tracking the S&P 500. You\u2019ll have broad exposure to the stock market without paying a lot in fees, and you won\u2019t have to worry about rebalancing as the tracked companies\u2019 fortunes rise and fall over time. The index fund\u2019s managers will take care of all that for you.\nFast FactCan you beat the billionaires? Perhaps surprisingly, you can. From 2020 to 2024, aggregate billionaire wealth in North America grew by 58.5%, from $3.8 trillion to $6.1 trillion, according to the UBS Billionaire Ambitions Report 2024. Over roughly the same period, the S&P 500 index grew 78%, demonstrating the power of U.S. equities markets and the wisdom of index fund investing. FXAIX has returned 11.02% since its inception in 1988. At that rate of return and annual contributions of $61,984, you will acquire your first billion in 71 years.\nStrategyAnnual InvestmentInterest RateTotal ContributionsTotal Interest EarnedYearsTotalMattress$61,9840.00%$1,000,049,856.00$0.0016,134$1,000,049,856.00Passbook Savings$61,9840.41%$63,781,536.00$939,679,759.761,029$1,003,461,295.76Jumbo CD$61,9844.55%$9,235,616.00$1,021,093,327.08149$1,030,328,943.08High-Yield Savings$61,9844.75%$8,925,696.00$1,031,526,660.71144$1,040,452,356.71S&P 500 Index Fund$61,98411.02%$4,400,864.00$103,635,073.1971$1,044,062,234.59\n\n A whole lifetime is longer than most average wage earners have to invest, but what a wonderful legacy to pass on to your children or grandchildren.

That's now more than an eighth of a percentage point above last week's 6.50% reading, which was its most affordable level in four and half months.\n Back in September, 30-year rates plunged\u2014sinking as far as a two-year low of 5.89%. In the ensuing three months, however, the average surged almost 1.25 percentage points, before recently retreating.\n Rewinding further, the 30-year average jumped to a high 7.37% last April, so today's rates are significantly improved vs. last spring. They're also 1.35 percentage points cheaper than the historic 23-year peak of 8.01% reached in October 2023.\n Rates on 15-year mortgages added 5 basis points Wednesday to a new average of 5.78%\u2014which is 18 points pricier than their recent four-month low.

What Causes Mortgage Rates to Rise or Fall?  Mortgage rates are determined by a complex interaction of macroeconomic and industry factors, such as:\nThe level and direction of the bond market, especially 10-year Treasury yieldsThe Federal Reserve's current monetary policy, especially as it relates to bond buying and funding government-backed mortgagesCompetition between mortgage lenders and across loan types Because any number of these can cause fluctuations simultaneously, it's generally difficult to attribute the change to any one factor.\n Macroeconomic factors kept the mortgage market relatively low for much of 2021. In particular, the Federal Reserve had been buying billions of dollars of bonds in response to the pandemic's economic pressures. This bond-buying policy is a major influencer of mortgage rates.\n But starting in November 2021, the Fed began tapering its bond purchases downward, making sizable reductions each month until reaching net zero in March 2022. Between that time and July 2023, the Fed aggressively raised the federal funds rate to fight decades-high inflation. While the fed funds rate can influence mortgage rates, it doesn't directly do so. In fact, the fed funds rate and mortgage rates can move in opposite directions.\n But given the historic speed and magnitude of the Fed's 2022 and 2023 rate increases\u2014raising the benchmark rate 5.25 percentage points over 16 months\u2014even the indirect influence of the fed funds rate has resulted in a dramatic upward impact on mortgage rates over the last two years.\n The Fed maintained the federal funds rate at its peak level for almost 14 months, beginning in July 2023. But in September, the central bank announced a first rate cut of 0.50 percentage points, and then followed that with quarter-point reductions in November and December.\n For its first meeting of the new year, however, the Fed opted to\u00a0hold rates steady\u2014and it\u2019s possible the central bank may not make another rate cut for months. At their Dec. 18 meeting, the Fed released its quarterly rate forecast, which showed that, at that time, the central bankers\u2019 median expectation for the coming year was just two quarter-point rate cuts. With a total of eight rate-setting meetings scheduled per year, that means we could see multiple rate-hold announcements in 2025.\n How We Track Mortgage Rates  The national and state averages cited above are provided as is via the Zillow Mortgage API, assuming a loan-to-value (LTV) ratio of 80% (i.e., a down payment of at least 20%) and an applicant credit score in the 680\u2013739 range.

{"url": "https://www.investopedia.com/special-needs-trust-vs-able-account-5217834", "title": "Special Needs Trust vs. ABLE Account: What's the Difference?", "text": " Special Needs Trust vs. ABLE Account: An Overview  Both ABLE accounts and supplemental needs trust (SNT), also known as supplemental needs trusts, allow the accumulation of resources for the benefit of an individual with a disability without jeopardizing key federally funded benefits, like Supplemental Security Income and Medicaid.\n Though both financial tools serve a similar purpose, there are key differences in how they function and their rules regarding contributions, usage of funds, and management.\n In this article, we will explore both options and highlight the differences between an ABLE account and an SNT, so you can make an informed decision based on your specific needs.\nKey TakeawaysBoth ABLE accounts and SNTs enable individuals with disabilities (or their families) to save money without impacting eligibility for programs like SSI or Medicaid.ABLE accounts are easier to set up and manage, but they come with limits on how much money can be contributed each year.SNTs do not have contribution limits but can be expensive and more complicated to establish.You don\u2019t have to choose one over the other; you can use both an ABLE account for everyday expenses and an SNT for larger expenses that aren\u2019t covered by public benefits. Supplemental Needs Trusts (SNTs)  A supplemental needs trust (SNT) is a way for an individual with a disability to receive money without losing access to their public benefits.\n Most public assistance programs for people with disabilities have income and asset restrictions\u2014if an individual with a disability earns too much or has too much money in savings, they will no longer be eligible for these benefits. An SNT is a way around this restriction. Money put in the trust doesn't count toward the purpose of qualifying for public assistance.\n An SNT is a legal arrangement and fiduciary relationship. In a fiduciary relationship, a person or entity acts on behalf of another person or people to manage assets. An SNT is a popular strategy for those who want to help someone in need without taking the risk that the person will lose their eligibility for programs that require their income or assets to remain below a certain limit.\n The individual who creates the trust can rest assured that the money contributed will be used as outlined in the creation of the trust. Furthermore, benefiting both the beneficiary and the trust creator, assets in the trust cannot be claimed by creditors or in the loss of a lawsuit. It\u2019s also important to recognize that the money in an SNT can only be used for healthcare needs, transportation, and other qualifying costs. Advantages of SNTs No contribution limitsProtects funds from creditorsEnsures continued eligibility for SSI and Medicaid Disadvantages of SNTs Setting up an SNT can be expensive and complex, often requiring legal assistance.Funds must be used for specific, non-basic needs (such as healthcare and therapy) and cannot cover regular living expenses like rent or groceries. ABLE Accounts  In many ways, an ABLE account is similar to an SNT. An ABLE account is a tax-advantaged savings account available to individuals with significant disabilities that began before the age of 26. Contributions can be made to the account by the beneficiary, friends, or family members, just as with an SNT. Money saved in an ABLE account doesn\u2019t affect a person\u2019s eligibility for public benefits. There are also tax benefits to setting up an ABLE account\u2014while the contributions themselves are not intended to be tax-deductible, the funds within the account grow tax-free and distributions are tax-free. ABLE accounts are a much newer financial product than SNTs. They were created by the 2014 Achieving a Better Life Experience (ABLE) Act as a way of giving more people access to the benefits that, up until then, were restricted to those who held SNTs. ABLE accounts can be used to pay for a wider range of things than the money in an SNT. The money in an ABLE account can be used to pay for any qualified disability expenses (QDEs). Advantages of ABLE Accounts Easier to set up and manage than SNTs.Funds grow tax-free, and withdrawals for qualified disability expenses (QDEs) are tax-free as well.Can be used for a broader range of expenses than SNTs, including basic living costs like housing and food. Disadvantages of ABLE Accounts Annual contribution limits (currently $19,000 in 2025).There are state-specific limits on the total balance that can be held, typically up to $300,000.Money left in an ABLE account after the individual\u2019s death may be used to reimburse the state Medicaid agency for services provided.Fast FactThere is an annual limit to how much you can contribute to an ABLE account: $19,000 in 2025. SNTs have no limits. Key Differences  There are three main differences between SNTs and ABLE accounts: eligibility, the expenses permitted for each type of account, and the limits on how much money you can save through them. Eligibility  ABLE accounts are offered to those meeting certain requirements. You only have to meet one of the following:\nEligible for SSI determined by a disability or blindness that occurred before the age of 26Eligible for benefits, including disability insurance benefits, childhood disability benefits, and disabled widow/widower benefits determined by a disability or blindness that occurred before the age of 26A certificate proving that your disability or blindness occurred before the age of 26 An individual that qualifies for disability according to the Social Security Administration has to set up a first-party SNT before they reach 65. Third-party trusts, however, have no age restrictions. First-party SNTs are invested with assets that belong to the beneficiary while third-party trusts are invested with assets from anyone but the beneficiary.\n Account Limits  ABLE accounts have contribution limits as well as amount limits. You can only contribute a certain amount each year. This amount is set federally under the same tax code governing 529 plans: $19,000 in 2025. In addition, ABLE accounts have a maximum limit set by the state that manages them. Many states set this limit above $300,000, with only the first $100,000 exempt from impacting eligibility for supplemental security income (SSI). SNTs have no such limits. One disadvantage of SNTs is that they can be expensive to set up. You will typically need to hire an attorney to set up the trust. In contrast, setting up an ABLE account is fast and easy, and can be done directly through the state's website. No attorney or financial advisor assistance is needed. Permitted Expenses  The third main difference between these accounts concerns what you can use them to pay for.\n Put simply, SNTs are supposed to pay for \"extra\" things that make life more comfortable, such as vacations, pets, entertainment, home furnishings, assistive technology, therapies not covered by Medicaid, and more. These are things that public benefits cannot pay for. If the money in an SNT is used to pay for basic costs of living, a person\u2019s public benefits might be decreased.\n ABLE accounts have a broader range of permitted expenses. This includes anything that helps a person with a disability improve their health, independence, or quality of life. QDEs can include basic costs of living, as well as costs for education, food, employment, transportation, technology, support services, and more. Other Differences  As well as the fundamental differences mentioned above, these accounts differ in several other ways. These features may make a big difference to you, depending on your situation.\nEveryday management: In general, money in SNTs is more difficult to access. The funds in ABLE accounts can be accessed easily, and many programs offer a debit card that allows you to pay for items directly from the account.Who manages the account: ABLE accounts are owned and managed by a person with disabilities, who is responsible for making sure that they only spend money on allowable expenses. SNTs are managed by trustees, who are responsible for keeping records of expenses.Tax: The money you keep in an ABLE account is tax-free, but the money kept in an SNT is taxable each year.Medicaid liability: Money left in a person\u2019s ABLE account after they die may be used to reimburse the state Medicaid agency for services Medicaid paid for after the ABLE account was created, depending on state regulations. There is often no money left after Medicaid is paid back. SNTs that were created with a parent, grandparent, or other person\u2019s money (known as a third-party trust) do not have to repay Medicaid after a person dies. SNT vs. ABLE Account: Which Is Better?  Every family\u2019s needs and circumstances are different, and when making financial decisions it\u2019s best to consult a professional. You can find lists of financial professionals who work with people with disabilities online, and the ABLE National Resource Center provides a comparison tool to help you understand how each type of account can help you. It\u2019s also important to realize that you don't need to choose between an ABLE account and an SNT. You can in fact have both. These accounts are best used for different purposes, despite having some characteristics in common.\nImportantThe money in SNTs is to pay for \u201cextra\u201d expenses that are not covered by public benefits. You can use the money in an ABLE account for a much broader range of expenses, including the basic costs of living, education, food, employment, and transportation. You should set up an ABLE account if you or a family member qualify. This will ensure that the individual with disabilities, whether you or a family member, will be able to obtain benefits. There may be additional benefits as well, such as tax relief.\n There are many factors to consider when choosing the best option for your family, points out Juliana Crist, senior consultant at AKF Consulting, a municipal advisor to state-run investment plans. \u201cThings like guardianship orders, end-of-life planning, tax considerations, Medicaid payback, and total assets all play into the decision of which financial tool to use,\u201d Crist says. Her firm, she continues, \u201calways likes to say that SNTs and ABLE accounts are complementary tools\u2014they work very well together.\u201c\n Establishing an SNT is strategically viable if you need to sequester more money than an ABLE account allows, which is up to $100,000. If you put in more than $100,000, then SSI benefits will be suspended.Can I Have an SNT and an ABLE Account?Yes, you can have both. And you can even set up an SNT so that it can fund an ABLE account.Who Controls an SNT?The most common type of SNT is a third-party trust set up by parents to benefit their children. In this case, the parents act as trustees. A trustee is a person or entity who manages the trust assets and administers the trust provisions.Does Autism Qualify for an ABLE Account?Yes, autism is a disability that qualifies for an ABLE account. The Internal Revenue Service lists the disabilities that qualify, which the Social Security Administration will accept for SSI or SSDI. The Bottom Line  Both ABLE accounts and SNTs allow a person diagnosed with disabilities\u2014or their relatives\u2014to save money without affecting their eligibility for public benefits. Prior to 2014, only SNTs could be used for this purpose, and they can be expensive to establish.\n ABLE accounts are much easier to set up and manage. However, they come with some disadvantages: primarily, limits on the amount of money you can save each year. You don\u2019t have to choose one or the other, though. It\u2019s possible to set up an ABLE account for everyday expenses and have an SNT that you can use for larger purchases that are not covered by public benefits.", "tags": ["www.investopedia.com", "special-needs-trust-vs-able-account-5217834", "wwwinvestopediacom"]}

This can be due to some loan types being less popular among mortgage shoppers, such as the 10-year fixed rate, resulting in the average being based on a small sample size of rate quotes.\n\nImportantThe rates we publish won\u2019t compare directly with teaser rates you see advertised online since those rates are cherry-picked as the most attractive vs.\u00a0the averages you see here. Teaser rates\u00a0may involve paying points in advance or may be based on a hypothetical borrower with an ultra-high credit score or for a smaller-than-typical loan.\u00a0The rate you ultimately secure will be based on factors like your credit score, income, and more, so it can vary from the averages you see here. Since rates vary widely across lenders, it's always wise to shop around for your best mortgage refinance option and compare rates regularly, no matter the type of home loan you seek.\n Calculate monthly payments for different loan scenarios with our Mortgage Calculator.\n What Causes Mortgage Rates to Rise or Fall?  Mortgage rates are determined by a complex interaction of macroeconomic and industry factors, such as:\nThe level and direction of the bond market, especially 10-year Treasury yieldsThe Federal Reserve's current monetary policy, especially as it relates to bond buying and funding government-backed mortgagesCompetition between mortgage lenders and across loan types Because any number of these can cause fluctuations at the same time, it's generally difficult to attribute any single change to any one factor.\n Macroeconomic factors kept the mortgage market relatively low for much of 2021. In particular, the Federal Reserve had been buying billions of dollars of bonds in response to the pandemic's economic pressures. This bond-buying policy is a major influencer of mortgage rates.\n But starting in November 2021, the Fed began tapering its bond purchases downward, making sizable reductions each month until reaching net zero in March 2022. Between that time and July 2023, the Fed aggressively raised the federal funds rate to fight decades-high inflation. While the fed funds rate can influence mortgage rates, it doesn't directly do so. In fact, the fed funds rate and mortgage rates can move in opposite directions.\n But given the historic speed and magnitude of the Fed's 2022 and 2023 rate increases\u2014raising the benchmark rate 5.25 percentage points over 16 months\u2014even the indirect influence of the fed funds rate has resulted in a dramatic upward impact on mortgage rates over the last two years.\n The Fed maintained the federal funds rate at its peak level for almost 14 months, beginning in July 2023. But in September, the central bank announced a first rate cut of 0.50 percentage points, and then followed that with quarter-point reductions in November and December.\n For its first meeting of the new year, however, the Fed opted to\u00a0hold rates steady\u2014and it\u2019s possible the central bank may not make another rate cut for months. At their Dec. 18 meeting, the Fed released its quarterly rate forecast, which showed that, at that time, the central bankers\u2019 median expectation for the coming year was just two quarter-point rate cuts. With a total of eight rate-setting meetings scheduled per year, that means we could see multiple rate-hold announcements in 2025.\n How We Track Mortgage Rates  The national and state averages cited above are provided as is via the Zillow Mortgage API, assuming a loan-to-value (LTV) ratio of 80% (i.e., a down payment of at least 20%) and an applicant credit score in the 680\u2013739 range. The resulting rates represent what borrowers should expect when receiving quotes from lenders based on their qualifications, which may vary from advertised teaser rates. \u00a9 Zillow, Inc., 2025.

{"url": "https://www.investopedia.com/articles/mutualfund/05/shareclass.asp", "title": "The ABCs of Mutual Fund Share Classes", "text": " Every time you invest in a mutual fund, you're making a choice that could cost or save you tens of thousands of dollars\u2014and you might not even know it. That's because mutual funds often come in different \"share classes,\" each with unique fees and requirements. Think of it like buying airline tickets: while everyone's flying to the same destination, some passengers pay full price, others use miles, and a few get upgraded to first class.\n Each share class\u2014typically labeled A, B, or C\u2014comes with its own combination of upfront costs, ongoing fees, and investment minimums. Whether you're just starting to invest or you're managing a substantial portfolio, understanding mutual fund share classes can help you maximize your returns.\nKey TakeawaysMost investors first see share classes in their workplace retirement plans, where the choice is often preselected.If you're investing a large sum at once (typically $25,000 or more), class A shares usually offer the best long-term value through reduced fees and \"breakpoint\" discounts.While C shares have become popular for their \"no upfront fee\" appeal, their higher ongoing costs can eat away at returns by as much as 1% annually compared with other share classes.The rise of low-cost exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and no-load funds has made traditional mutual fund share classes less relevant for individual investors. What Are Mutual Fund Classes?  When you put money into a mutual fund, you're joining forces with other investors to create a pool of money professionals will invest in stocks, bonds, or other investments. The mutual fund industry created share classes decades ago to give investors flexibility in paying for professional management. But with today's shift toward low-cost index funds, share classes matter less than before. In addition, if you invest through a workplace retirement plan, these choices are already made for you.\n However, if you're investing on your own or through a fee-only advisor, understanding these differences is more important. Class A Shares Class A shares charge an upfront sales fee (known as a front-end load) that's taken out before your money goes to work. It might sound counterintuitive to pay fees upfront, but think of it like buying in bulk at Costco Wholesale Corp. (COST): You pay for a membership upfront to save money over time.\n If you've got a larger sum to invest, typically $25,000 or more, you might qualify for what the industry calls \"breakpoint discounts.\" These slash your upfront fees.ProsLower 12b-1 (marketing) feesBreakpoint and other discounts the more you investSome funds offer discounts if you provide a letter stating your intent to invest moreConsHigher initial investment for discountsGiven upfront costs, these aren't for more short-term investing Class ADV  Advisor-class shares (ADV shares) represent the \"subscription model\" of mutual fund investing. Instead of paying commissions or sales charges, you're paying a steady fee to a financial advisor (so-called fee-only advisors) who can access these special share classes on your behalf.\nProsNo front-end loadLower expense ratioPart of advisory relationshipNo 12b-1 feesConsAdvisory feeSome advisors charge higher minimumsOnly available via these advisors Class B Shares Class B shares are becoming as rare as paper stock certificates. Where they exist, you don't pay upfront fees, but you will face charges if you sell your shares within a given period. While this might sound appealing, there's a reason they're fading away: they often end up being more expensive in the long run.\nProsNo front-end feesThe exit fees decrease each year you stay investedTypically convert to lower-cost A shares after six years or moreConsThe annual fees are typically higher than other share classesPenalties for early withdrawal/sale of shares Class C Shares Class C shares are the \"no commitment\" option of the mutual fund world. While they don't hit you with a big upfront fee as with A shares, they make up for it by charging higher ongoing fees\u2014indefinitely.\nProsYou avoid the sticker shock of upfront fees, keeping your full investment working for you from day oneYou can typically sell within a year without facing major penaltiesThese shares offer more flexibility for investors who aren't sure about their long-term plansConsFees are higher than A shares, and they compound over timeMost C shares never convert to lower-cost optionsNo discounts Class D Shares  Class D shares are found in mutual fund markets and from discount brokerages like Charles Schwab, Fidelity, or TD Ameritrade. They're for DYI investors working without an advisor.ProsYou skip the traditional sales charges while still having access to professional fund managementOngoing costs are typically lower than other retail share classes since you're not paying for advisor servicesFlexibility to buy and sell through major investment platformsConsYou might face trading fees from your brokerage platform, even though the fund itself doesn't charge themYou'll need to meet higher minimum investment requirements in many casesNot every fund family offers D shares, limiting your investment choicesNo professional guidance Classes F, I, R, and Y  These shares are specialized for specific types of investors or situations.\n Here's what makes each one unique:\nF Shares: These might be used when working with a fee-based advisor.I Shares: These are for institutional investors, who get something of a bulk rate (lower fees) since they invest massive sums.R Shares: These are used primarily in 401(k) and other retirement plans and have lower fees to support long-term growth.Y Shares: Another set of shares aimed at institutional or high-net-worth clients making significant investments.Fast FactThe rise of ETFs has caused mutual fund fees to drop substantially over the last couple of decades. That's because ETFs don't come with loads, etc., and have shares that trade on exchanges like stocks. The Bottom Line  While these different share classes once played a bigger role in how people invested, they're becoming less relevant for many individual investors. That said, there are specific situations where choice of share class still matters significantly, such as when you're investing larger amounts, using them as part of a retirement plan, or when you have a specific type of advisor.\n Today's investment landscape offers many alternatives, from low-cost index funds to ETFs. Focus on keeping your total investment costs low, understanding exactly what you're paying for, and choosing investments that align with your financial goals, risk tolerance, and timeline.\n", "tags": ["www.investopedia.com", "articles", "wwwinvestopediacom"]}

{"url": "https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/recession-resistant.asp", "title": "Recession Resistant: Definition, How It Works, and Examples", "text": " What Does Recession Resistant Mean?  An entity that is not significantly affected by recessions is recession resistant. Recession resistance can apply to products, companies, jobs, or industries.\n For example, products such as gasoline and basic food items may be considered recession resistant because people will continue to consume them whether or not there's an economic downturn.\nKey TakeawaysRecession resistant refers to entities such as stocks, companies, or jobs that are not greatly affected by a recession.Examples of industries considered recession resistant include consumer staples, alcoholic beverage manufacturers, discount retailers, and funeral service providers.Fixed-income instruments can also be recession resistant, such as 10-year Treasury securities, which increased in value during the Great Recession (2007-2009). How Recession Resistance Works  Many investors include assets in their portfolios that are expected to perform well in hard economic times. Industries thought to be recession resistant include consumer staples, alcoholic beverage manufacturers, discount retailers, and funeral service providers.\n These industries supply goods and services that economists describe as either income inelastic or inferior goods. Income-inelastic demand is when the demand for a good doesn\u2019t change much when incomes change. People tend to keep buying basic staples, for example, even when their incomes fall during a recession. Inferior goods are those where demand actually increases when incomes fall. Lower-cost consumer goods from discount retailers fall into this category.\n In addition to belonging to recession-resistant industries, resilient companies are likely to have strong balance sheets. This is especially true if the company has little debt and healthy cash flows\u2014this will allow them to maintain operations and even take advantage of the depressed market to make new investments more cheaply. By contrast, companies with a lot of debt may fall behind as a growing share of their revenue is absorbed by debt payments.\nDividend-paying stocks are another good place to invest when times are tough. Companies that pay dividends tend to be in mature industries. Look for companies that have maintained and expanded their dividends, including through past recessions, and that have ample resources to continue making payments.\nImportantAside from stocks, fixed-income instruments such as government and corporate bonds tend to do comparatively well in a recession, as investors tend to seek more conservative and predictable investments. Also, interest rates tend to fall during a recession, pushing up the value of existing bonds. Recession-Resistant Stocks During the Great Recession (2007\u20132009)  The S&P 500 Index declined by more than 40% from January 2008 to January 2009, one of its worst-ever annual declines. The years around this event have come to be known as the Great Recession.\n But recession-resistant securities did far better than the stock market as a whole. During that same time frame, shares in Walmart Inc. (WMT) declined by only 3.7%, while shares in McDonald\u2019s Corp. (MCD) virtually broke even. Holders of fixed-income securities did even better than investors in these stocks, with 10-year Treasury securities starting at 5.65% in 1999 and falling to 3.26% in 2009. Recession-Resistant Stocks During the Most Recent Recession (2020)  The latest recession in early 2020 was caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, which devastated populations and economies around the world. While the recession technically only lasted two months, its impact extended for several months afterward.\n However, as in prior recessions, not every stock suffered as much as others. In particular, low-cost retailers like Walmart outperformed the S&P 500 by 5.5%, according to CFRA, a stock research and rating company. Other stocks in recession-resistant sectors, such as consumer staples, home improvement, and Big Pharma, also outperformed the S&P 500, according to CFRA. Among other recession-resilient companies that outperformed the S&P 500 in the 2020 recession, according to CFRA, were:\nAbbott Laboratories (ABT), at 9.8% over the S&P 500The Home Depot Inc. (HD), at 5.3%Synopsis Inc. (SNPS), a semiconductor/software testing firm, at 70%Accenture PLC (ACN), at 7.8%T-Mobile US Inc. (TMUS), at 55.7%The Walt Disney Co. (DIS), at 9%Are Recession-Resistant Stocks Guaranteed to Go Up in a Recession?First, there are no guarantees in the stock market. The most we can say is that recession-resistant stocks may go up during a recession, but they typically don\u2019t fall as much as broader market indexes.Second, there may be stock-specific events that cause certain stocks to outperform others during a recession. Such was the case with T-Mobile in 2020, when it outperformed the S&P 500 Index by 70%. T-Mobile had just merged with Sprint to become the largest telecommunications company in the world, and coupled with the early rollout of its 5G network, this put the company at an advantage over other telecom companies such as Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ) and AT&T Inc. (T).What Do Recession-Resistant Stocks Have in Common?Recession-resistant stocks are typically companies that produce goods and services that are needed regardless of the business cycle. These are commonly known as consumer staples. Discount stores in this sector, such as Walmart and Dollar Tree Inc. (DLTR), tend to see an uptick in traffic as consumers seek to buy staple goods at lower prices. Other sectors, such as home improvement and entertainment stocks, are also examples of consumers seeking lower-cost alternatives to activities that they would ordinarily engage in.How Can I Take Advantage of Recession-Resistant Stocks?First, consider the sectors that are the most resilient in times of recession, such as consumer staples and pharmaceuticals.Then you can seek out the best-performing stocks in those sectors, some of which will be trading at a discount to historical performance (dragged down by the overall decline in stocks) or outright gaining because of cyclical demand. Such a situation could represent a discounted stock price and a buying opportunity.Finally, while some recession-resistant stocks may be at bargain prices during the recession, it may take several months for them to be fully repriced at their fair value, so be patient. The Bottom Line  Recession-resistant stocks are those shares that do not fall as much as the market or post positive gains during a recession. The key sectors to focus on when trying to buy recession-resistant stocks are typically those that provide necessary goods and services no matter what stage the business cycle is in.\n Key sectors to follow are consumer staples, utilities, discount retailers, and pharmaceuticals. These sectors will likely not be immune to overall stock market declines, but they may represent a good buying opportunity at a discounted price courtesy of the recession.\n", "tags": ["www.investopedia.com", "terms", "wwwinvestopediacom"]}

{"url": "https://www.investopedia.com/companies-owned-by-pfizer-5211303", "title": "7 Companies Owned by Pfizer", "text": " Pfizer Inc. (PFE) is a global biopharmaceutical company engaged in the discovery, development, manufacture, and sale of medicines and vaccines. Its business spans vaccines, oncology, internal medicine, hospital, inflammation and immunology, and rare disease. Some of Pfizer's most recognizable products include Advil, Lyrica, Zoloft, Viagra, Xanax, ChapStick, and Preparation H. Pfizer traces its origins to 1849 when Charles Pfizer and Charles Erhart founded Charles Pfizer & Co. in Brooklyn, New York. The company became a publicly traded company in 1942. Two years later, in 1944, Pfizer succeeded in mass-producing penicillin, becoming the largest producer worldwide of the first antibiotic. More recently, the company was at the forefront of efforts to stem COVID-19. In August 2021 its COVID-19 vaccine was the first to receive full approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The vaccine, along with COVID-19 treatment Paxlovid, helped make Pfizer the world's top-ranked drug company by revenue in 2021.Key TakeawaysAcquisitions have fueled much of Pfizer's growth over the past decades.Buying new companies gives Pfizer access to new drugs and revenue streams as well as ways to create synergies.Its biggest deal to date was for Lipitor maker Warner-Lambert in 2000.Other notable acquisitions include Pharmacia, Wyeth, Seagen, Medivation, Hospira, and Array BioPhrarma. Acquisitions have fueled much of the company's growth over the past few decades. Its biggest occurred in 2000 with the acquisition of Warner-Lambert, which gave Pfizer control of Lipitor, a blockbuster drug used to treat high cholesterol.\n Pharmaceutical companies spend significant amounts of money to develop new drugs. Once patented, these drugs may enable companies to reap outsized profits as an exclusive producer for years before competitors are allowed to develop and market generic alternatives. Many of Pfizer's acquisitions were for companies with patented drugs. Its deal for Warner-Lambert and the ensuing buyout of Pharmacia in 2003 are two examples.\n The company has also targeted generic drugmakers with attractive drug pipelines, such as Hospira, and has been bolstering its pipeline of cancer treatments by acquiring several oncology-focused drug developers.\n We look in detail at seven of Pfizer\u2019s major acquisitions below. Warner-Lambert Type of business: pharmaceuticalsAcquisition price: $116 billion Acquisition date: June 20, 2000 (completed) Warner-Lambert was formed in 1955 when William R. Warner & Co. combined with Lambert Pharmacal Co. The company subsequently expanded primarily through acquisitions\u2014most notably the 1970 purchase of Parke-Davis, once the world\u2019s largest drugmaker. In 1996, Warner-Lambert and Pfizer entered into a co-marketing agreement for Lipitor, a synthetic lipid-lowering agent and one of the highest-selling drugs in the world. Lipitor was Pfizer's principal motivation in its hostile takeover bid for Lipitor developer Warner-Lambert.\n Pfizer feared losing its marketing deal for Lipitor, under which it received half of the profits from sales of the drug. Warner-Lambert initially rejected the takeover bid, but after months of court battles agreed in February 2000 to be acquired by Pfizer. The deal closed in June 2000 and went on to significantly boost Pfizer's revenues. Wyeth Type of business: pharmaceuticalsAcquisition price: $68 billionAcquisition date: Oct. 15, 2009 (completed) Wyeth started as John Wyeth and Brother, established in Philadelphia by John and Frank Wyeth in 1860. In the late 1960s, the company's Ovral was the leading oral contraceptive in the United States. It has since been discontinued. In January 2009, Pfizer agreed to purchase Wyeth in a deal valued at $68 billion. Acquiring Wyeth augmented Pfizer\u2019s portfolio by adding two key drugs: Prevnar, a vaccine for infants against pneumococcal disease; and Enbrel, an arthritis drug. The company viewed vaccines and injectable biologic medicines as therapeutic areas less vulnerable to generic competition and needed new products to soften the blow from the expected loss in revenue once the exclusivity period attached to the Lipitor patent ended. Pfizer completed the acquisition of Wyeth in October 2009 following approval by U.S. and Canadian antitrust regulators. Pharmacia Type of business: pharmaceuticalsAcquisition price: $60 billionAcquisition date: April 16, 2003 (completed) Pharmacia was formed in April 2000 by the merger between Pharmacia & Upjohn and Monsanto and its pharmaceutical unit Searle. At the time of the merger, Searle had an agreement with Pfizer to co-promote Celebrex, a blockbuster arthritis drug the companies developed together. Celebrex is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug used to temporarily relieve pain and inflammation. Pharmacia completed the spinoff of its agricultural subsidiary Monsanto in August 2002. The month before, in July 2002, Pfizer agreed to purchase Pharmacia for $60 billion. The deal, finalized in April 2003, gave Pfizer full rights to Celebrex during a time when pharmaceutical companies were struggling to develop new drugs, facing increasing competition from generic drugmakers, and pricing pressures from governments and private buyers. With this acquisition, Pfizer became the top pharmaceutical company by revenue in every major market in the world. Seagen Type of business: biotechnologyAcquisition price: $43 billionAcquisition date: December 14, 2023 (completed) Seagen, formerly known as Seattle Genetics, is a biotechnology company. It was formed in 1998 with a goal to combat cancer and became a publicly traded company three years later in 2001. Pfizer\u2019s acquisition of Seagen in 2023 furthered the company\u2019s strategic move into oncology, which is widely perceived to be one of the biggest growth markets in the pharmaceutical industry. Cancer cases continue to rise and Seagen, with its diverse and innovative drug portfolio, gives Pfizer another way to profit from this. Hospira Type of business: pharmaceuticals and medical devicesAcquisition price: $16 billion Acquisition date: Sept. 3, 2015 (completed) Hospira became an independent, publicly traded company in 2004 after a spinoff from Abbott Laboratories (ABT). Over the next decade, the company became a leader in developing and manufacturing biosimilars, medicines functionally similar to more expensive biotech drugs.\n Hospira\u2019s biosimilars pipeline was key to Pfizer's 2015 bid to purchase the smaller rival. Pfizer had spent years focusing on acquiring companies that manufactured costly biotech drugs shielded by patents. Meanwhile, the new focus by governments and health insurers on curbing soaring medical costs was expected to fuel global demand for biosimilars. Hospira was also a leading provider of injectable drugs and infusion technologies. Medivation Type of business: biopharmaceuticalsAcquisition price: $14.3 billion Acquisition date: Sept. 28, 2016 (completed) Medivation was founded in 2003 by David Hung and went public through a reverse merger with a shell company in 2004. A reverse merger occurs when a private company purchases a publicly traded one and takes over its exchange listing.\n Medivation specialized in developing cancer drugs. The big prize for Pfizer in acquiring the company in 2016 was Xtandi, a drug for treating prostate cancer. Xtandi was generating about $2 billion in annual sales for Medivation, and analysts were predicting that those sales could double.\n Medivation also had other oncology treatments under development. Pfizer expected these to benefit from combination with its research efforts, helping the company to become a leader in oncology. Array BioPharma Type of business: biopharmaceuticalsAcquisition price: $11.2 billionAcquisition date: July 30, 2019 (completed) Array BioPharma, a company focused on the discovery and development of targeted small molecule drugs to treat patients with cancer and other diseases, was founded in 1998. The biopharmaceutical company first began collaborating with Pfizer in 2017 on developing cancer drugs. Two years later, Pfizer paid a big premium to acquire Array BioPharma. The acquisition bolstered Pfizer\u2019s expanding portfolio of cancer treatments with Braftovi and Mektovi. These drugs treat metastatic melanoma and other cancers.How Many Products Does Pfizer Have?Pfizer makes, markets, or distributes hundreds of different drugs. A list of them can be found on its website.What Are the Biggest Pfizer Brands?Pfizer is behind many well-known drugs. Some of its most recognizable products include Advil, the COVID-19 vaccine, Lyrica, Viagra, and Xanax.Who Are the Top 10 Owners of Pfizer?The biggest shareholders of Pfizer, as of September 30, 2024, are Vanguard, Blackrock, and State Street. Combined, these institutional investors own just under 20% of Pfizer's total outstanding shares. The Bottom Line  Acquisitions offer pharma companies a quick way to innovate and grow product portfolios. Pfizer has been one of the most active in the sector. Over the past few decades, Pfizer, known for its COVID-19 vaccination, Viagra, Xanax, and a host of other drugs, has spent billions buying up other companies.\n Its biggest deal to date was for Warner-Lambert, the maker of Lipitor, in 2000. Other notable acquisitions the company has made include Pharmacia, the manufacturer of anti-inflammatory drug Celebrex, Wyeth, whose product portfolio includes Prevnar and Enbrel, cancer drug developers Seagen and Medivation, Hospira, a producer of acute-care and oncology injectables, and small molecule drug manufacturer Array BioPharma.\n", "tags": ["www.investopedia.com", "companies-owned-by-pfizer-5211303", "wwwinvestopediacom"]}

Reckitt echoed those remarks in a press release Thursday.\n \"Today's verdict is consistent with the scientific consensus that there is no established causal link between the use of specialized preterm hospital nutrition products and NEC, and that where human milk is unavailable or when supplementation is necessary, specialized preterm hospital nutrition products can provide essential, lifesaving nutrition,\" Reckitt said.

On Wednesday, Morgan Stanley\u2019s report comes after it overcame softness in its wealth management business to report better-than-expected results. American Express\u2019 Friday earnings report comes after the credit card issuer\u2019s revenue was weaker in the prior quarter than analysts expected.\u00a0\n Citigroup, PNC Financial Services, and State Street also report on Tuesday, with Discover Financial Services and US Bancorp also issuing quarterly financials on Wednesday. Blackstone, Huntington Bancshares, and Truist Financial report on Thursday, and Fifth Third Bancorp issuing earnings on Friday.\n The Tuesday report from UnitedHealth Group will show if the health insurer can continue to drive revenues higher at its Optum division. Johnson & Johnson\u2019s Tuesday report follows a disappointing second quarter where one-time expenses forced the company to miss profit estimates. Medical device maker Abbott Labs will report on Wednesday, while Intuitive Surgical reports on Thursday.\u00a0\n Thursday will also be a big day for tech firms, with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing\u2019s report coming after its September sales totals rose; investors will also be looking closely at subscriber growth in Netflix\u2019s earnings.\u00a0\n Fed Representatives, Retail and Housing Data on Tap This Week  Market watchers will be following Fed representatives' public comments and economic indicators this week, while the bond market will be closed for the Columbus Day holiday on Monday.\n Several Fed officials will deliver remarks this week, starting with remarks from Fed Gov.

The girl contracted the illness, and while she survived, she suffers from neurological damage that requires long-term care.

{"url": "https://www.investopedia.com/these-are-the-best-performing-stocks-of-the-last-century-8680461", "title": "What a List of the Best-Performing Stocks of the Past Century Tells Us", "text": " Tech has offered investors some of the biggest returns over the last few decades\u2014and especially the last few years\u2014but over the long run, investors have seen massive gains from all over the market.\n A recent study from Arizona State University researcher Hendrik Bessembinder, who analyzed the price history of more than 29,000 U.S. stocks that traded between 1925 and 2023, reveals the range of companies that have made up the most successful investments of the last century based on their total return.\n Seven of the 30 best-performing stocks in the Center for Research in Security Prices (CRSP) database that Bessembinder studied belong to healthcare firms including Abbott Laboratories (ABT), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), and Pfizer (PFE). Aerospace and defense stocks, including General Dynamics (GD), Boeing (BA), and Northrop Grumman (NOC), were also among the most lucrative investments of the past century.\nAPI / Gamma-Rapho via Getty Images Coca-Cola (KO) and PepsiCo (PEP) were the ninth and tenth-best performers. They\u2019ve returned investors more than 12 million percent and 8 million percent, respectively, over the last 98 years. Hershey (HSY) and Tootsie Roll Industries (TR) also made the top 30.\n But of the products that made investors rich in the last century, one stands out as king: cigarettes. A person who invested $1 in Marlboro maker Altria Group (MO) at the end of 1925\u2014the equivalent of about $18 today\u2014and reinvested all their dividends, would have had $2.66 million at the end of last year. That's nearly seven times the return for the second-highest returning stock, construction materials supplier Vulcan Materials (VMC). Tobacco seller Universal Corp. (UVV) and smokeless tobacco giant UST Inc., which Altria bought in 2009, were also in the top 20.\n Investors typically don't hold stocks for nearly 100 years. But the data illustrates the effect a long time horizon can have on a portfolio\u2014as well as the opportunities that can arise all over the stock market.\n Where Does Tech Land?  Bessembinder divides the CRSP\u2019s stocks into four categories characterized by the duration of their price history: stocks with at least one year of data; stocks with more than one year but less than five years of data; stocks with more than five but less than 20 years of data; and those with more than 20 years of data.\n Of the U.S. stocks with more than 20 years of trading history, Nvidia (NVDA) has the highest annualized return (33.38%)\u2014and that\u2019s excluding its more than 130% performance so far this year. In the top 30, it\u2019s joined by four other big tech companies\u2014Netflix (NFLX; 32.06%), Amazon (AMZN; 31.78%), Microsoft (MSFT; 26%), and Adobe (ADBE; 23.93%).\u00a0\n But mixed in with these market darlings are the likes of Plenum Publishing Corp., a subsidiary of academic publisher Springer Nature, which delivered investors annualized returns of 32.09% between 1972 and its acquisition by Dutch publisher Wolters Kluwer in 1998. Taser maker Axon Enterprise (AXON), which debuted in 2001 and still trades on the Nasdaq, has returned 31.13% a year on average.\u00a0\n U.S. construction and housing have also been a boon to investors. Shares of Home Depot (HD) have returned more than 1.6 million percent in the 42 years that they\u2019ve traded publicly. That translates to an average annual return of nearly 26%. Pool materials supplier Pool Corp. (POOL) and homebuilder NVR (NVR) are also among the 30 best-performing stocks with 20-year histories. Time in the Market Beats Timing the Market  One of the clearest takeaways from Bessembinder\u2019s analysis may be that \u201ctime in the market\u201d is one of the most crucial determinants of an investor\u2019s success. Of the 30 CRSP stocks with the highest cumulative return, Northrop Grumman, with 72 years of price history, is the youngest. The median \u201cage\u201d of Bessembinder\u2019s top-performing stocks is more than 92 years.\n And just a few extra years of exposure can swell an investment portfolio's value. Since debuting in May 2002, Netflix has delivered an average annualized return of 32.06%. If you had bought $1 of Netflix stock at its IPO price, that dollar would have been worth $406.94 at the end of 2023.\n The same $1 IPO investment in Amazon, which debuted five years before Netflix but has a slightly lower average annual return, would have been worth $1,551.73\u2014nearly 4 times your Netflix stake.\u00a0 Still, the cohort of stocks with more than 20 years of price history was the only bunch in Bessembinder\u2019s analysis in which more than 50% of stocks delivered positive returns. The median return among all 29,087 stocks was -8%.\u00a0 Having one or two winners in your portfolio can make all the difference: The full data set\u2019s mean return, in which the massive gains of Altria and America\u2019s snacking giants have extra weight, was 22,840%.\nDo you have a news tip for Investopedia reporters?

Major U.S. equities indexes moved lower on Friday after data released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics revealed that the economy added more jobs than expected in May.\n Although the strong jobs report contradicted earlier indications of a potential economic slowdown, the surprising resilience in the labor market renewed doubts about when the Federal Reserve might move forward with interest rate cuts.\n The S&P 500 slipped 0.1%, while the Dow and the Nasdaq ended the session 0.2% lower.\n Shares of solar technology firm Enphase Energy (ENPH) tumbled 7.2%, suffering the steepest losses of any S&P 500 constituent, following the disclosure of a class action lawsuit filed against the company. The matter involves allegations of illegal business practices by officers or directors of the company related to inconsistencies in earnings and growth projections for the first quarter of 2023.\n The price of gold dropped over 3% after the jobs report dampened hopes for interest rate cuts and as data showed that China's central bank did not purchase any bullion for its official reserves in May.

Bitcoin halvings are part of its underlying technology, in which the rewards for bitcoin \u201cminers\u201d are periodically slashed in half, reducing the rate that new bitcoin is issued.\u00a0\nCryptocurrencies have gained in anticipation of the halving, with bitcoin prices hovering near the all-time-high it set in March. However, while past halvings have sent the cryptocurrency higher, experts said that the market conditions around this event are different. For example, new spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have changed market dynamics this year, and there has been a decline in the amount of bitcoin available to trade.\u00a0\n Bank Earnings Continue, With Notable Health Care, Tech Reports Also on Tap  After big banks kicked off the latest earnings season last Friday, more financial institutions are set to follow, with healthcare and tech firms also highlighting this week\u2019s reporting calendar.\n Goldman Sachs leads the way on Monday, coming after it reported strong growth in its asset and wealth management business for the fourth quarter. Tuesday features the report from Morgan Stanley, coming days after a report that regulators were probing the bank\u2019s wealth management arm. On Wednesday, Discover Financial Services delivers its financial results after the February announcement that it was being acquired by Capital One (COF). Closing the week is American Express (AXP), which reports its earnings after it last quarter gave strong full-year guidance and boosted its dividend.\u00a0\n Health insurer UnitedHealth Group reports on Tuesday amid reports that it\u2019s under antitrust investigation, with Johnson & Johnson also delivering financial results that day. Abbott Laboratories reports on Wednesday and Intuitive Surgical reports on Thursday.\n Other noteworthy earnings this week include Netflix\u2019s report on Thursday, with the streamer looking to keep up its momentum in subscriber growth.\u00a0 Consumer products giant Procter & Gamble\u2019s report on Friday will show whether higher prices continue to fuel revenue growth.\u00a0\n Federal Reserve Speeches and Economic Indicators  Investors will be listening to remarks from several Federal Reserve speakers this week, as the officials continue to deliver their reaction to changing economic data.\n San Francisco Fed President Mary C. Daly, New York Fed President John C. Williams, and Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic are all scheduled to deliver remarks during the week.\u00a0\n While the Fed has forecast three interest rate cuts for 2024, a surging jobs report and hotter-than-expected inflation has prompted some officials to raise questions about whether the Fed would be able to follow up with that projection. Several Fed officials last week said that recent inflation data has caused them to reconsider rate-cut schedules, arguing that they need to see more data showing price increases slowing before moving to trim rates.\u00a0\n Investors will also get an update on regional business conditions this week. The Federal Reserve banks in New York and Philadelphia will release surveys of business from their regions, while the Beige Book will include summaries of economic conditions in all 12 Fed regions.Correction\u2014April 16, 2024: This article was updated to reflect that United Airlines releases its financial results on Tuesday, April 16, 2024.\nDo you have a news tip for Investopedia reporters?

Many investment companies have some type of investment that tracks the index. Some of the most common ways to invest in the index (without having to buy the stocks of the individual companies listed on the index) include purchasing shares in mutual funds or exchange-traded funds (ETFs). ETFs are like stocks because they trade on stock exchanges and are more cost-effective because of the lower fees associated with them. Do your research or talk to an investment professional who can help you navigate through all the options.Can I Buy Shares in the S&P 500?No, you can't buy shares or invest directly in the S&P 500. That's because it is an index that is made up of some of the largest companies in the U.S. But you can invest in vehicles that track the index. Index funds and ETFs try to mimic the composition and returns of the index.What Does the S&P 500 Measure?The S&P 500 is an index that tracks the performance of 500 of the largest companies in the U.S. Because some companies have different share classes, the index is often made up of a few more stocks than 500. To be listed on the index, companies must have a market capitalization of more than $14.5 billion and must meet other criteria. Combined, the top 10 constituents make up more than 30% of the index's market value. The Bottom Line  The S&P 500 is one of the most widely watched and tracked indexes in the global financial markets. It is made up of 500 of the largest companies in the U.S. Because of the vast market values of the companies in the S&P 500, the index is considered a gauge of the U.S. economy. Investors who are interested in taking advantage of the returns may want to consider buying shares in an index fund or ETF.\nDo you have a news tip for Investopedia reporters?

Shares of Abbott, the nation\u2019s largest maker of infant formula, traded nearly 1% lower in intraday trading on the news as of 12:30 p.m. Eastern Time.\n In documents posted to the FTC website, the agency said it wanted more information from Abbott on its bids for\u00a0U.S. Department of Agriculture\u2019sWomen, Infants, and Children (WIC) federal nutrition assistance program grants. The consumer protection agency that investigates fraud and anti-competitive behavior told Abbott it wanted information on bids for both WIC and non-WIC infant formula contracts.\u00a0\n \u201cIn 2022, the Commission initiated an investigation into whether any participant in infant formula markets has engaged in collusion or coordination with any other market participant regarding the bidding for WIC contracts,\u201d according to the FTC document issued in April requesting information from Abbott.\u00a0\n While Abbott has said it will provide information on WIC contracts, the company has pushed back on the FTC regarding providing non-WIC information, agency documents showed. Abbott had already attracted attention from the FTC, USDA, and White House after it was at the center of a nationwide baby formula shortage in 2022. Abbott Has Dominance in Infant Formula Market  The FTC said Abbott controls 48% of the infant formula market, which has just three manufacturers. More than half of infant formula sales in the U.S. are made through the USDA\u2019s WIC program. State agencies that administer WIC infant formula programs bid them out to suppliers in multi-year contracts.\n The FTC cited a 2015 USDA study of bidding on WIC infant formula contracts between 2003 and 2013 that found patterns of potentially non-competitive bidding. Abbott is only one of three manufacturers to bid on WIC infant formula contracts since 1996, the FTC noted.\u00a0\n Abbott initiated a nationwide recall in 2022 and closed a plant in Michigan after bacterial contamination in the company\u2019s formula was blamed for at least two infant deaths. The resulting shortage and production loss prompted the White House to coordinate a national response. The FTC documents did not tie issues with bids for WIC contracts to the 2022 formula shortage.\nDo you have a news tip for Investopedia reporters?

(MRK) is trading higher by about 1% in Tuesday's pre-market after booking a third quarter 2020 profit of $1.74 per share, $0.31 better than consensus estimates. Revenue rose a modest 1.2% year over year to $12.55 billion, also beating expectations. The pharmaceutical giant topped off the bullish report by raising 2020 guidance more than 10%, but the weak post-news reaction highlights continued investor apathy.\nKey TakeawaysMerck beat third quarter top- and bottom-line estimates and raised full-year guidance.The modest post-news reaction highlights persistent investor apathy.The 3.07% dividend is more attractive than the mixed price pattern. Merck has a deep pipeline of cancer, pain management, and HIV treatments but joined the COVID-19 hunt later than its rivals and just started early trials. Merck shares rallied with pandemic-focused stocks mid-year, when the broad sector attracted a strong bid, but have now settled into a bearish pattern that has sliced through support at the 50- and 200-day exponential moving averages (EMAs). The $81.50 level marks the dividing line between bull and bear power in this price structure, or about two points above this morning's opening print.\n Wall Street rates Merck as a \"Moderate Buy\" based upon eight \"Buy\" and three \"Hold\" recommendations. No analysts are recommending that shareholders close positions and move to the sidelines. Price targets currently range from a low of $84 to a Street-high $105, while the stock is set to open the session about $4 below the low target. This divergence highlights the current attraction to tech and other growth sectors, rather than old-school pharma plays. Even so, the 3.09% forward dividend yield is keeping current shareholders in place.\nTipA public company's guidance is its report to shareholders on the earnings it expects to achieve in the quarter or fiscal year ahead. Alternatively referred to as earnings guidance or a\u00a0forward-looking statement, the report typically includes revenue estimates, projected earnings, and capital spending estimates. Merck Monthly Chart (2000 \u2013 2020) TradingView.com\u00a0 A multi-year uptrend topped out at $96.69 in November 2000, marking a high that wasn't challenged for the next 20 years, ahead of an persistent downtrend that carved three broad selling waves into March 2009's 13-year low in the mid-$20s. A slow-motion recovery completed a round trip into the 2007 swing high in the low $60s in 2014, yielding a quick rally, followed by a failed breakout that reinforced resistance.\n A second breakout after the 2016 presidential election suffered the same fate, topping out in the mid-$60s in the first quarter of 2017. The stock posted a two-year low at $52.83 in April 2018, marking the best buying opportunity of the decade, ahead of a steady advance that completed the three-year breakout attempt in the third quarter. The uptrend posted solid returns into December 2019, when it reversed within four points of the 2000 high.\n Merck Short-Term Outlook  The stock sold off to a two-year low during the first quarter and bounced in two rally waves, reversing at the .786 Fibonacci selloff retracement level in September. It has now crossed into a monthly stochastic sell cycle, predicting mixed action into the first quarter of 2021. More importantly, accumulation readings have plummeted since posting an all-time high in December 2019, warning that institutions have pulled up stake in favor of other opportunities.\n In the shorter term, Merck stock is extremely oversold on a weekly basis, raising the odds for an intermediate bounce that will face a buzz-saw of resistance in the mid- to upper $80s. A buying spike above the September high at $87.80 is needed to improve the longer-term outlook and set up supportive conditions for a test at the 2019 high. Unfortunately, that doesn't seem to be in the cards in the fourth quarter.\nTipOversold refers to a condition where an asset has traded lower in price and has the potential for a price bounce. An oversold condition can last for a long time, and therefore being oversold doesn't mean a price rally will come soon, or at all. Many\u00a0technical indicators\u00a0identify oversold and\u00a0overbought\u00a0levels. The Bottom Line  Merck stock is trading higher after a strong third quarter earnings report, but persistent investor apathy is likely to continue.\u00a0\nDisclosure: The author held no positions in the aforementioned securities at the time of publication.Do you have a news tip for Investopedia reporters?

Its business is organized into two main divisions: pharmaceuticals and diagnostics.\n Roche develops drugs and treatments across various areas, including oncology, neuroscience, infectious diseases, immunology, cardiovascular and metabolism, ophthalmology, and respiratory ailments. Roche's top-selling drug in FY 2023 was Ocrevus, used to treat multiple sclerosis. Hemophilia treatment Hemlibra brought in $4.8 billion, and its cancer drug Perjeta generated $4.5 billion.Who Is Pfizer's Largest Competitor?Johnson & Johnson is Pfizer's largest competitor. Johnson & Johnson does not generate as much revenue from its pharmaceuticals, but the company's market cap of $348.5 billion as of Jan. 14, 2025, and its 2023 revenue of $85.1 billion makes it undeniably a rival.How Is Pfizer Different From Other Companies?Pfizer is behind many pharmaceutical innovations that are copied or mimicked in generic versions. Pfizer continues to monitor their generics and assume responsibility for them even after the patent expires.What Is Pfizer's Competitive Advantage?Pfizer's intellectual property and continuous development of new medicines are its competitive advantages. The Bottom Line  Pfizer began manufacturing chemicals in 1849, eventually pivoting to pharmaceutical research in the 1950s. Since then, it has become one of the biggest pharmaceutical companies in the world, with only a few companies reaching the status of peers. Pfizer has 30 active pharmaceutical patents. It also has 108 products, as of Oct. 29, 2024, in its development pipeline.", "tags": ["www.investopedia.com", "ask", "wwwinvestopediacom"]}
{"url": "https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/12/why-do-some-companies-pay-a-dividend.asp", "title": "Companies That Pay Dividends\u2014and Those That Don't", "text": " Dividends are after-tax corporate income that companies pass on to their shareholders. They can be in the form of cash payments,\u00a0shares of stock, or other property.\n Dividends may be issued at a frequency chosen by a company, although many companies pay dividends quarterly and in amounts that increase over time.\n There are a number of reasons why a corporation may choose to pay shareholders dividends, and several other reasons why it might prefer to reinvest all of its earnings back into the company.\nKey TakeawaysDividends are payments from corporate net income that companies pass on to their shareholders.Paying dividends sends a message about a company's future prospects and performance.Its willingness and\u00a0ability to pay\u00a0steady dividends over time provide a solid demonstration of a company's financial strength.A company that is still growing rapidly usually won't pay dividends because it wants to invest as much as possible into further growth.Mature firms that believe they can increase value by\u00a0reinvesting their earnings\u00a0may choose not to pay dividends.\u00a0 Why Some Companies Issue Dividends  Here's why issuing dividends can be a good idea for a mature company with stable earnings that doesn't need to reinvest as much in itself:\nMany investors like the steady income associated with dividends, so they will be more likely to buy that company's stock.Investors also see a dividend payment as a sign of a company's financial strength and management's positive expectations for future earnings, which again makes the stock more attractive. Greater demand for a company's stock will increase its price.Increasing dividend amounts from companies with a history of continuous dividend payments are also highly appealing to investors. Examples of companies that pay dividends include Apple (AAPL), Coca-Cola (KO), McDonald's (MCD), Merck (MRK), Microsoft (MSFT), Occidental Petroleum (OXY), Wells Fargo (WFC), and Verizon (VZ).\nImportantOne of the simplest ways for companies to foster goodwill among their shareholders, drive demand for the stock, and communicate financial well-being and\u00a0shareholder\u00a0value is by paying dividends. Why Some Companies Do Not Issue Dividends  On the other hand, some companies decide that the money they've earned is needed elsewhere:Young, fast-growing companies typically won't make dividend payments. That's because it's fiscally shrewder to reinvest the cash back into operations during pivotal growth stages.Even well-established companies might decide to reinvest their earnings to fund new initiatives, acquire other companies, or pay down debt. All of these activities tend to spike share prices.Companies often reinvest earnings in lieu of making dividend payments to avoid the potentially high costs associated with issuing new stock. In addition, the choice not to pay dividends may be more beneficial to investors, from a tax perspective:\n Non-qualified (ordinary) dividends are taxable to investors as ordinary income. This means that an investor's tax rate on dividends is the same as their marginal tax rate which can be as high as 37%.Qualified dividends are taxed at the long-term capital gains rates, either 0%, 15%, or 20%. What you pay depends on your marginal income tax bracket. (Take a look at the table in the next section to determine the rate that might apply.)\nDoes Amazon Pay Dividends?Some large and notable companies do not issue dividends. For example, Amazon has never declared or paid a cash dividend on its common stock. Other companies that have not paid dividends include Biogen and Tesla. Long-Term Capital Gains Tax Rates on Qualified Dividends  The table below shows the maximum amounts of income that determine the long-term capital gains tax rate that recipients of qualified dividends would pay, as of tax years 2024 and 2025. Income above the maximum amount for the 15% rate for each filing status would result in the 20% rate.Filing Status\u00a02024 Maximum 0% Rate Amount2024 Maximum 15% Rate Amount2025 Maximum 0% Rate Amount2025 Maximum 15% Rate AmountSingle$47,025$518,900$48,350$533,400Married Filing Separately$47,025$291,850$48,350$300,000Head of Household$63,000$551,350$64,750$566,700Married Filing Jointly$94,050$583,750$96,700$600,050Surviving Spouse$94,050$583,750$96,700$600,050Estates & Trusts$3,150$15,450$3,250$15,900\n\nWhere Can I Find the Total Amount of My Qualified Dividends?You can find your ordinary and qualified dividend amounts on Form 1099-DIV that you'll receive from financial institutions and companies that pay you dividends. The amount for qualified dividends in particular appears in box 1b.Do Companies Ever Stop Paying Dividends?Yes, companies can suspend their dividend payments. Keep in mind that dividends are not guaranteed. Companies might halt them if they're in financial trouble, have a large, unexpected expense that must be paid, or decide to invest earnings in a project that can add to future growth.What Company Has Paid Dividends the Longest?A number of U.S. companies have paid dividends without stopping for many years. For example, the York Water Company has paid a dividend non-stop for over 200 years. Stanley Black and Decker has paid a dividend continuously since 1877. And Exxon-Mobil has paid a dividend no matter the difficulties since 1882. The Bottom Line  When a company pays dividends, it returns some of its profits directly to shareholders, sending a signal to the market of stable and reliable operations.\n Newer companies, or those in the technology space, often opt instead to redirect profits back into the company for growth and expansion, so they do not pay dividends. Rather, this reinvestment of retained earnings is often reflected in a rising share price and capital gains for investors.\n", "tags": ["www.investopedia.com", "ask", "wwwinvestopediacom"]}

Since its inception in May 1896, the index has changed its components dozens of\u00a0times. The first change occurred a mere three months after it was founded, and numerous companies have come and gone over the years. For instance, General Electric (GE) was removed in June 2018, and Exxon-Mobil (XOM), Pfizer (PFE), and RTX, formerly Raytheon Technologies, (RTX) were chopped in August 2020. Intel (INTC) and Dow Inc. (DOW)\u00a0were removed from the index in November 2024. But these aren't the only famous names to be dropped from the Dow Index. Other U.S. household names have gotten the boot over the decades\u2014and more are sure to face the same fate in the future. None of the original companies on the index remain.\nKey TakeawaysThe Dow Jones Industrial Average consists of 30 American blue-chip companies.The index's composition changes periodically.Some of the most iconic companies in U.S. history have been removed from the DJIA, including General Electric, AT&T (T), Sears, and General Motors (GM).After GE's removal in 2018, none of the original components of the DJIA remained in the index. What Is the Dow Jones Industrial Average?  The Dow Jones Industrial Average, known simply as the DJIA or the Dow, is an index consisting only of large, blue-chip companies that broadly represent the U.S. economy. It has historically included some of the most prominent and most influential companies globally.\n A company that loses a large percentage of its market capitalization because of financial distress might be removed from the Dow. Market capitalization is a method of measuring the value of a company by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by its stock price. When companies lose enough market cap, they may be removed from the index, such as when AIG was replaced by Kraft Foods in 2008 amid the financial crisis.\n As the economy changes over time, so does the composition of the index. A component of the Dow may be dropped when a company becomes less relevant to present trends of the economy, replaced by a new name that better reflects the shift.TipWhen the DJIA index initially launched in 1896, it included only 12 companies. Those companies were primarily in the industrial sector, including railroads, cotton, gas, sugar, tobacco, and oil. Bethlehem Steel  Bethlehem Steel offers a great example of how economic changes over the decades can lead to changes in the DJIA. Bethlehem Steel was at one time the second-largest U.S. producer of steel. By the 1970s, cheaper imported foreign steel was beginning to take its toll on Bethlehem's top-line revenue. By the 1980s, the company began shutting down some of its operations to cut costs to\u00a0remain profitable.\n Due to its declining business, Bethlehem Steel was removed from the Dow in 1997 after a seven-decade run. The company declared bankruptcy in 2001, and its remaining assets were sold off in 2003. Those assets exist today as part of Mittal\u00a0(MT).\n General Electric  General Electric\u00a0(GE) was\u00a0one of the original Dow stocks when the index was created in 1896. However, GE has had a volatile history with the\u00a0DJIA. It was removed from the Dow twice in the index's early days\u2014it was dropped from the index in 1898 before it rejoined the Dow the following year in\u00a01899.\n After being dropped again in 1901, it returned to the Dow in 1907, where it was a mainstay for more than a century before being replaced in 2018. In fact, GE was the longest-running DJIA component, lasting 122 years.\nFast FactThere are some\u00a0current Dow stocks that were also dropped at one time\u00a0only to return later. IBM (IBM)\u00a0joined the DJIA in 1932, but it was absent from 1939 to 1979 before returning for good. Coca-Cola (KO) also joined the DJIA in 1932, but wasn't part of the index from 1935 to 1987, before returning. AT&T was removed from the Dow in 1928, 2004, and again in 2015. Citigroup  The Travelers Companies joined the DJIA in 1997 as part of the biggest single update to the index, when four of the 30 components were changed. In 1998, Travelers merged with Citicorp, and the newly combined entity named Citigroup (C)\u00a0inherited Travelers' spot in the Dow. Citigroup was subsequently removed from the Dow following the 2008 financial crisis, when the company's market cap shrank by over 90% and it teetered on the brink of bankruptcy. Travelers (TRV) was spun off from Citigroup in 2002 and went on to replace Citigroup in the Dow in 2009.\n Sears  For decades, Sears Roebuck Co., which joined the Dow in 1924, was a household name across America and an enormous force in U.S. business and consumer culture. Its headquarters in downtown Chicago was the world's tallest building for a quarter century. Sears was eclipsed as the nation's largest retailer by Walmart Inc. (WMT) at the end of the 1980s. About a decade later, in 1999, Sears was removed from the DJIA following a 75-year run.\n AT&T  As a sign of the changing times toward information technology and social media as the primary form of communication, the stalwart telephone company AT&T was replaced by Apple Inc. (AAPL) in 2015. Before that, AT&T had been a part of the Dow since 1916. Pfizer  While Pfizer Inc. (PFE) may have seen a big boost due to its successful COVID-19 vaccines, the company was nevertheless dropped from the Dow in 2020. This was seen as a surprising move for many, but the index also hosts Merck & Company Inc. (MRK), which is a similar pharmaceutical company, and the index didn't need two. Exxon-Mobil  The oil giant Exxon-Mobil was also removed from the Dow at the same time in 2020, ending its 92-year inclusion in the index (the second-longest consecutive run behind GE). The primary reason was due to overlap with other oil companies in the index (i.e., Chevron). The change accompanied a broader trend affecting the oil industry, exacerbated by falling oil prices and reduced demand, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic.\u00a0\n Walgreens-Boots  The pharmacy and retail chain Walgreens-Boots Alliance Inc. (WBA) was dropped from the index in early 2024, following a three-for-one stock split that lowered the company's price weighting below the required threshold. Walgreens has faced challenges in recent years, including declining sales and competition from both traditional and online retailers.\n The decision underscored Walgreens' diminished influence relative to other companies that were then driving growth in the retail sector.\n Intel  In November 2024, Intel Corporation (INTC) was dropped from the index, primarily due to its declining performance in the semiconductor industry and the rise of competitors like NVIDIA Corp. (NVDA), which replaced it in the Dow. Intel suffered a significant downturn, with its stock price falling by over 50% in 2024. The company reported continuous financial losses, including a projected loss exceeding $20 billion for that year, which raised concerns among investors and other stakeholders about its future viability as an industry leader.What Are the Criteria for Inclusion in the Dow?The Dow includes 30 large, blue-chip American stocks, but the methodology is largely subjective and doesn't follow a fixed, quantitative rule. The stocks that are included tend to be exemplars of important sectors of the U.S. economy, have a strong track record of growth, and be of interest to a large number of investors.Who Chooses the Dow Jones Components?The Dow Jones Industrial Average's components are selected by a committee, and the index itself is owned by S&P Global, which also runs the S&P 500 index.Who Invented the Dow Jones Index?Charles Dow was an American journalist who founded a financial news bureau, originally called Dow, Jones & Co., with a colleague, Edward Davis Jones in 1896. It was launched with 12 of the biggest and most influential corporations of the day. Each was a giant in its sector, and most reflected demand for the raw materials that fed the American economy, like coal, sugar, and oil. The Bottom Line  The Dow Jones Industrial Average is a stock market index that tracks 30 large public companies in the U.S. The index, established in 1896, is one of the most widely tracked indexes in the world. As such, it is used as a benchmark or a standard for performance measurement. The index's composition isn't static, which means companies may be removed and added to keep up with the pace of the U.S. economy.", "tags": ["www.investopedia.com", "articles", "wwwinvestopediacom"]}

The company argues the process for setting prices is less like a negotiation and more like a \u201cgun to the head\u201d that lets the government dictate terms.\nUnder the program, Medicare, the government\u2019s health insurance program for seniors, would be able to negotiate the prices it pays for certain drugs for the first time instead of accepting prices set by manufacturers. The government would choose 10 drugs to negotiate in the first year of the program, with more being added in later years, including, potentially, Keytruda. That would save money both for the government and for Medicare recipients, with the amount of the savings depending on which drugs are chosen for negotiation.\u00a0\n Merck says the negotiation process, which involves the government determining a \u201cmaximum fair price\u201d for products, is unfair. Companies that don\u2019t comply with the negotiation process face civil penalties and a heavy tax on the drugs they sell. Drugmakers can avoid the tax and the negotiation process if they don\u2019t accept reimbursements from Medicare and Medicaid. Merck argues this is no choice at all. \u201cThis is not \u2018negotiation,\u2019\u201d the company said in the lawsuit. \u201cIt is tantamount to extortion.\u201d\u00a0\n The company said it expects its diabetes drug, Januvia, to potentially be one of the initial 10 drugs to be negotiated. Januvia is one of the costliest drugs covered by Medicare Part D. The government paid $3.9 billion to provide the drug for 934,686 patients in 2022\u2014more than $4,100 per patient, according to data from the Johns Hopkins Drug Access and Affordability Initiative.In 2022, Medicare spent $17 billion on Keytruda, an immunotherapy with a list price of up to $21,794.24 per dose.\u00a0\nDo you have a news tip for Investopedia reporters?

Last year, the federal government began price negotiations with participating drug makers under the IRA.\n Price Cuts Weren't Guaranteed  The negotiations were met with opposition from\u00a0multiple large pharmaceutical firms such as Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) and Merck (MRK), as well as the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA), lobbyists for the pharmaceutical industry.\n These drugmakers sued, saying the negotiation process was unfair. Merck argued the process is less like a negotiation and more like a \"gun to the head.\" So far, all court decisions have ruled in favor of the federal government and allowed the government to continue negotiations. The 10 drugs with reduced costs include medicines that help care for life-threatening conditions such as diabetes, heart failure and cancer.\u00a0\n Prices for up to 15 more drugs covered by Medicare Part D will be negotiated in 2025, the White House said.\nDo you have a news tip for Investopedia reporters?

Major U.S. equities indexes were mixed for the second straight day as tech stocks lost ground ahead of key earnings reports and a decision on interest rates from the Federal Reserve.\n The S&P 500 lost 0.5%, while the Nasdaq dropped 1.3%. The Dow closed Tuesday's session 1.5% higher, buoyed by a strong performance from several constituents in the financial services sector.\n Merck (MRK) shares tumbled 9.8%, posting the steepest decline of any S&P 500 stock Tuesday, after the pharmaceutical giant lowered its full-year earnings forecast. The cut reflected a one-time charge related to the acquisition of ophthalmology biotech company EyeBio. The stock's losses came despite a solid second-quarter performance, with better-than-expected revenue and earnings driven by growing sales of Merck's flagship cancer drug Keytruda.\n Shares of CrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD) plunged 9.7% following news that Delta Air Lines (DAL) could sue the cybersecurity firm for financial damages related to the global tech outage caused by a CrowdStrike software update earlier this month.

Howmet posted better-than-expected sales and profits for the period, with its commercial aerospace division receiving a boost from strong air travel demand and an aging aircraft fleet. The company also increased its share buyback authorization and raised its dividend.\n F5 (FFIV) shares jumped 13% after the online security and cloud-based technology firm beat revenue and earnings expectations for its fiscal third quarter. An increase in digitization efforts by companies aiming to capitalize on artificial intelligence (AI) trends helped lift demand for F5's services and hardware products, while high-profile security breaches and elevated online threat levels led to growing cybersecurity investments. A strong set of earnings results and an increased outlook also helped lift shares of Stanley Black & Decker (SWK), which added 10% on the day. Second-quarter sales and profits surpassed analysts' estimates, and the manufacturer of tools and industrial equipment lifted its full-year earnings guidance. Although Stanley Black & Decker said it could see muted demand in the remainder of 2024, it touted its focus on streamlining its supply chains as a way of driving earnings and cash flow growth.Do you have a news tip for Investopedia reporters?

After the decision this week, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell will take media questions.\u00a0\n The employment report on Friday comes as Federal Reserve officials are keeping a close eye on the labor market following a rise in unemployment last month.

But how Fed Chair Jerome Powell talks about the meeting afterwards could have an impact on markets.\u00a0\n Powell\u2019s comments after the Dec. 12 meeting gave investors hope that the Fed would begin cutting interest rates in 2024. But following those comments, some Fed officials have raised questions about the timing of cuts, and minutes from the December meeting showed there was still division among members on interest rates.\n Investors will also be listening closely to Powell\u2019s comments on the potential impact of recent economic data that raised questions about whether inflation will continue to fall. Since the last meeting, the Fed has seen a stronger-than-expected jobs report, an uptick in inflation, and a strong reading for fourth-quarter Gross Domestic Product.\u00a0\n US Employment Report Friday Could Show Labor Market's Resilience Can the labor market keep it up? Investors will find out on Friday, when the U.S. employment report for January will show whether the economy can again beat estimates on job creation.\n The year ended with a strong jobs report for December, when 216,000 jobs added raced past estimates of 170,000 new jobs, and followed an unexpected drop in the unemployment rate in November.\u00a0\n Market watchers will also be paying attention to wage data released with the report to see if average hourly pay continued to grow. Higher wages are good for workers, but could act to slow the fight against inflation as employers raise prices on goods and services to pass on higher costs to consumers.\u00a0\n Tech, Pharma, and Energy Earnings on Tap Artificial intelligence (AI) will likely be a key topic of discussion when several leading tech companies report earnings this week, including Microsoft, Google, AMD (AMD), Meta, and Apple.\u00a0\n When it delivers its report on Tuesday, Microsoft will update investors on its AI growth after integrating tools into products like its Bing search engine and Office software suite.\u00a0Microsoft will also provide an update on growth from its Azure cloud service, which helped push the tech giant to an earnings beat in the prior quarter.\u00a0\n Google parent Alphabet will report on Tuesday, when its AI products will be in the spotlight, with analysts expecting the search giant to again report growth in revenue and earnings, after the previous quarter where it showed a 9% year-over-year gain in ad revenue. Chipmaker AMD's report that day will provide insight into the demand for AI semiconductors.\u00a0\n On Thursday, Apple could report its first year-over-year quarterly revenue gain in a year and its best earnings per share in two years as sales of the iPhone 15 take effect. The report will come as the company wrestles with some signs of slowing demand for its iPhones, though analysts believe AI products could boost interest in its devices. Meta's report comes after CEO Mark Zuckerberg recently detailed its investment in AI chips.\u00a0Amazon is also expected to report on how its investments into AI are benefiting its AWS cloud division.\u00a0\n Several pharmaceutical companies will report this week as well. Novo Nordisk could continue its momentum from sales of its weight-loss drug Wegovy when it reports on Wednesday.\u00a0 On Thursday, Merck\u2019s report will show whether demand for its cancer and COVID-19 treatments remain high. AbbVie (ABBV), Novartis (NVS) and\u00a0 Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) are also scheduled to report this week.\n Investors will be watching for aircraft delivery numbers when Boeing (BA) reports on Wednesday.

{"url": "https://www.investopedia.com/articles/stocks/08/dow-history.asp", "title": "Why the Dow Matters", "text": " The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) is one of the most quoted financial barometers in the world and has become synonymous with the financial markets in general. When people say the market has gone up or down by a certain number of points, there\u2019s a good chance they're referring to changes in the Dow.\u00a0\nKey TakeawaysThe Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) was created to serve as a stock market and economic indicator.\u00a0Charles Dow\u2019s first version of the DJIA appeared in the Wall Street Journal in 1896, containing 12 stocks.\u00a0The DJIA expanded to 30 stocks in 1928, which is the number of stocks it still maintains today.\u00a0The DJIA has proved to be a solid representation of the broader market, closely tracking the much more inclusive Wilshire 5000 index.\u00a0\u00a0 Brief History Charles Dow, the creator of the DJIA, devised his first stock index in 1884. It consisted of two capitalized industrial and 12 capitalized railroad companies. Dow's intent was to track U.S. economic strength by closely observing the companies considered to be the backbone of the U.S. economy.\u00a0\n In 1896, Dow altered the index to contain 10 railroads and two industrials. In the mid-1890s, Dow recognized the growing importance of the industrial sector in the U.S. economy and again altered the index, this time to consist solely of industrial stocks. The first version of the DJIA, which contained 12 stocks, appeared in TheWall Street Journal on May 26, 1896. The companies chosen were:American Cotton OilAmerican SugarAmerican TobaccoChicago GasDistilling & Cattle FeedingGeneral ElectricLaclede GasNational LeadNorth American UtilityTennessee Coal and IronU.S. Leather pfd.U.S. Rubber While an odd-looking combination by today's economic standards, these 12 stocks were carefully chosen to represent the major areas of the U.S. economy at the time. The 30-stock Dow Jones Industrial Average debuted in 1928. It was made up of:Allied ChemicalAmerican CanAmerican SmeltingAmerican SugarAmerican TobaccoAtlantic RefiningBethlehem SteelChryslerGeneral ElectricGeneral Motors CorporationGeneral Railway SignalGoodrichInternational HarvesterInternational NickelMack TruckNash MotorsNorth AmericanParamount PublixPostum IncorporatedRadio CorporationSears Roebuck & CompanyStandard Oil (N.J.)Texas CompanyTexas Gulf SulphurUnion CarbideU.S. SteelVictor Talking MachineWestinghouse ElectricWoolworthWright Aeronautical The DJIA has changed over the years, with some stocks being removed and others added to maintain an accurate reflection of the U.S. economy. Of the original 12 Dow stocks, General Electric (GE) is the only one that stood the test of time, remaining in the index until 2018. There are also two other Dow averages, the\u00a0Dow Jones Utility Average (DJUA)\u00a0and the\u00a0Dow Jones Transportation Average (DJTA), which consists of stocks in the railroad, trucking, shipping, and airline industries. Today's Dow  The table below alphabetically lists the companies included in the DJIA as of June 2024:Dow Jones Industrial Average ComponentsCompanySymbolYear Added3MMMM1976AmazonAMZN2024American ExpressAXP1982AmgenAMGN2020AppleAAPL2015BoeingBA1987CaterpillarCAT1991ChevronCVX2008Cisco SystemsCSCO2009The Coca-Cola CompanyKO1987DowDOW2019Goldman SachsGS2013The Home DepotHD1999HoneywellHON2020IBMIBM1979IntelINTC1999Johnson & JohnsonJNJ1997JPMorgan ChaseJPM1991McDonald'sMCD1985Merck & Co.MRK1979MicrosoftMSFT1999NIKENKE2013Proctor & GamblePG1932SalesforceCRM2020The Travelers CompaniesTRV2009UnitedHealth GroupUNH2012VerizonVZ2004VisaV2013WalmartWMT1997The Walt Disney CompanyDIS199130 DJIA companies as of June 2024\n\n As you can see, today's Dow consists of many household names that the average American comes across on a daily basis. It's also evident from the year added column that the companies that make up the index aren't chopped and changed on a regular basis.Fast FactThe longest-serving company currently in the DJIA is Proctor & Gamble. The consumer goods giant was first added to the index in 1932. Is the Dow a Reliable Economic Indicator?  Considering the breadth of today's economy, one might mistakenly believe that an index consisting of a mere 30 stocks could hardly be of any value. That is simply untrue. In addition to representing 30 of the most highly capitalized and influential companies in the U.S. economy, the Dow is also the financial media's most referenced U.S. market index and remains a good indicator of general market trends.\n If one compares a pricing chart of the Dow with a chart of the Wilshire 5000, the most inclusive of all U.S. indexes, it is evident that the two have followed astonishingly similar paths. The Dow has historically begun to decline for extended periods before the more speculative Nasdaq index, a pattern that occurred in the stock market downturns that began in April of 1998, January 2000, December 2001, January 2004, December 2004, and October 2007. Some believe that when the stocks of DJIA companies begin to show weakness, the U.S. economy may be headed for a slowdown.\n Dow Theory  The DJIA can also be used with another Dow Jones index covering transportation to determine the direction of the stock market.\u00a0\n During his career, Charles Dow came up with a theory that the market is in an upward trend if one of the averages he created, either industrials or transportation, advances above a previous important high and is accompanied or followed by a similar advance in the other one. In other words, if the DJIA climbs to a high and the DJTA follows a similar pattern around the same time, it would confirm a bull market. Likewise, if both indexes were to move notably down in quick succession, it could indicate an incoming bear market. The Dow Theory makes six basic assumptions:\nA stock\u2019s price reflects everything that is known about the stock.There are three primary kinds of market trends: a primary trend, which lasts a year or more, a secondary trend, which represents smaller movements, such as a\u00a0pullback\u00a0within a bull market or a rally within a bear market, and a minor trend, which lasts a few days or weeks.Primary trends have three phases: In an uptrend, they are the accumulation, public participation, and excess phases. In a downtrend, they are the distribution, public participation, and panic phases.The averages must confirm each other: For a trend to be valid, the industrials and transport indexes must move in a similar direction.The volume confirms the trend: When the price is moving in the direction of the primary trend, the volume should increase. If this doesn\u2019t happen, the trend can be considered weak.Trends persist until a clear reversal occurs: Uptrends are defined by a series of higher highs and higher lows and downtrends by a series of lower\u00a0peaks\u00a0and lower\u00a0troughs. In the case of a bull market ending, prices must exhibit at least one lower high and one lower low. Ways to Invest in the DJIA  There are a number of ways to invest in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. The most obvious is to buy shares of the companies it includes. But several exchange-traded funds (ETFs) also track the price movements of the Dow, including the SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF (DIA) and ProShares Ultra Dow30 (DDM).Is the Dow more important than the S&P 500?A lot of pundits consider the S&P 500 to be more reflective of the state of the stock market and economy because it includes more companies, weights them according to size, and is revised on a more frequent basis. Still, the Dow tends to be quoted more and has proved over the years to be fairly representative of the U.S. equity market, despite containing just 30 stocks. A lot of that is down to the companies being well-chosen.Should I invest in Dow, Nasdaq or S&P 500?That depends on what kind of investor you are. The S&P 500 contains more stocks and is, therefore, in theory, more diversified, whereas the Nasdaq, despite holding some of the country\u2019s biggest companies, is generally considered to be more speculative by nature because of its focus on technology. The Dow, on the other hand, is often criticized for just having 30 stocks. But, in its defense, the companies in this index are very diverse and fairly evenly represented. They are also personally handpicked by a committee for their quality characteristics.Each of these indexes has something to offer. The Nasdaq is generally associated with growth and volatility, the Dow with stable earnings and decent dividends, and the S&P 500 with a little bit of both.What is the advantage of Dow Theory?Dow theory can help traders to identify trends in the market and determine in which direction it is heading. The theory does make a lot of sense. However, like all trading frameworks, it isn\u2019t flawless and won\u2019t always deliver the desired results. When investing, it\u2019s wise not to rely on and blindly follow just one theory. Accompany other people's observations with different analyses and your own due diligence. The Bottom Line  The DJIA isn\u2019t loved by everyone. Some argue that this index, which consists of 30 blue chips considered to be the most important names on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and NASDAQ,\u00a0doesn\u2019t achieve its goal of reflecting the health of the U.S. economy because it consists of just 30 companies and puts more weight on share prices than market capitalization.\n There is a reason, though, why the Dow is the financial media's most referenced U.S. market index. Despite all the criticism, it has actually proven to be a fairly reliable indicator of where the stock market and economy are heading. Over the years, its price movements have closely mirrored the Wilshire 5000, a much broader index covering 5000 U.S.-listed stocks. And when its constituents, who are major employers and are heavily invested in the economy struggle, the wider economy tends to start stuttering, too. These are just some of the reasons why the Dow matters and is frequently talked about.\n", "tags": ["www.investopedia.com", "articles", "wwwinvestopediacom"]}

In the United States, accountants follow the generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) when they compile financial statements. Outside the U.S., many countries follow the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), which aims to establish a common global language for company accounting.\n About 160 jurisdictions have made a public commitment to IFRS reporting standards, and 147 require publicly listed entities to follow IFRS accounting standards. While the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)\u00a0has openly expressed a desire to switch from GAAP to IFRS, development has been slow.Key TakeawaysGAAP, or generally accepted accounting principles, is the common set of accepted accounting standards and procedures that U.S. accountants follow when they compile financial statements.IFRS is a\u00a0set of international accounting standards that state how particular transactions and other events should be reported in financial statements.Some accountants consider methodology to be the primary difference between the two systems; GAAP is rules-based and IFRS is principles-based.Many countries are transitioning all financial reporting to the IFRS standard. GAAP  In the United States, if a company distributes its financial statements outside of the company, it must follow generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP. If a corporation's stock is\u00a0publicly traded, financial statements must also adhere to rules established by the U.S.\u00a0Securities and Exchange Commission. GAAP addresses such things as\u00a0revenue recognition,\u00a0balance sheet,\u00a0item classification, and outstanding share measurements. If a financial statement is not prepared using\u00a0GAAP, investors should be cautious. Also, some companies may use both GAAP- and non-GAAP-compliant measures when reporting financial results. GAAP regulations require that non-GAAP measures are identified in financial statements and other public disclosures, such as press releases. IFRS International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) are issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), and they specify exactly how accountants must maintain and report their accounts. IFRS was established in order to have a common accounting language, so businesses and accounts can be understood from company to company and country to country. The point of IFRS is to maintain stability and transparency throughout the financial world. IFRS enables the ability to see exactly what has been happening with a company and allows businesses and individual investors to make educated financial decisions. IFRS is standard in the\u00a0European Union\u00a0(EU) and many countries in Asia and South America, but not in the United States. The\u00a0Securities and Exchange Commission won't switch to International Financial Reporting Standards in the near term but will continue reviewing a proposal to allow IFRS information to supplement U.S. financial filings.\u00a0\nFast FactWhile GAAP is required for U.S. companies that trade on the stock market, it is not required for private companies. Key Differences  The primary difference between the two systems is that GAAP is rules-based and IFRS is principles-based. This difference appears in specific details and interpretations.\n IFRS guidelines provide much less overall detail than GAAP. Consequently, the theoretical framework and principles of the IFRS leave more room for interpretation and may often require lengthy disclosures on financial statements. On the other hand, the consistent and intuitive principles of IFRS are more logically sound and may possibly better represent the economics of business transactions.\n Perhaps the most notable difference between GAAP and IFRS involves their treatment of inventory. IFRS rules ban the use of last-in, first-out (LIFO) inventory accounting methods. GAAP rules allow for LIFO. Both systems allow for the first-in, first-out method (FIFO) and the weighted average-cost method. GAAP does not allow for inventory reversals, while IFRS permits them under certain conditions. Investing  When a company holds investments such as shares, bonds, or derivatives on its balance sheet, it must account for them and their changes in value. Both GAAP and IFRS require investments to be segregated into discrete categories based on asset type.\n The main differences come in recognizing income or profits from an investment. Under GAAP, it's largely dependent on the legal form of the asset or contract. Under IFRS, the legal form is irrelevant and only depends on when cash flows are received. Explain Like I'm Five  Each country sets its own standards for financial reporting. Much like the metric system, these standards ensure that accountants follow a uniform set of rules when they record a company's revenues, expenses, profits, and losses.\n For most of the world, accountants follow the IFRS rules. In the United States, the leading standard is called GAAP. Although there have been some discussions of transitioning the U.S. to the IFRS standard, there is little likelihood of that happening in the near future.What Is the Difference Between the IASB and FASB?The International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), founded in 2001 and based in Canary Wharf (England) oversees and updates the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) establishes and updates the accounting rules for the GAAP standard in the U.S.Which Is Better: IFRS or GAAP?This is a matter of perspective. IFRS is more principles-based, while GAAP is rules-based. A focus on principles may be more attractive to some as it captures the essence of a transaction more accurately. In practice, however, since much of the world uses the IFRS standard, a convergence to IFRS could have advantages for international corporations and investors alike.How Are Expenditures Related to Research and Development Treated Under U.S. GAAP vs. IFRS?Research & development, or R&D, is a large expense in many industry sectors. Under GAAP R&D expenses are booked as they occur. This is true under IFRS as well, however, IFRS also requires certain R&D expenditures to be capitalized (e.g. some internal costs like prototyping). The Bottom Line  Any company that distributes financial statements publicly should use some form of established accounting principles. Two common ones are GAAP and IFRS.\n In the United States, generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, are used by businesses with public financial disclosures. This system uses rules-based accounting. However, many countries are adopting the use of International Financial Reporting Standards, or IFRS, as an established international accounting system.\n IFRS is principles-based and may require lengthy disclosures in order to properly explain financial statements. It is the established system in the European Union\u00a0(EU) and many Asian and South American countries. It has not yet been adopted as an official system in the United States. However, any company that does a large amount of international business may need to use IFRS reporting on its financial disclosures in addition to GAAP.\n", "tags": ["www.investopedia.com", "ask", "wwwinvestopediacom"]}

In the U.S., the standards to follow are generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). In many other countries, companies are guided by international financial reporting standards (IFRS).Key TakeawaysAccounting principles are guidelines companies and other bodies must follow when recording and reporting accounting transactions.They bring uniformity to financial statements and make it easier to understand, analyze, and compare them.Accounting principles in the U.S. are called generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).In many other countries, international financial reporting standards (IFRS) are used.Ryan Oakley / Investopedia What Are Accounting Principles?  Accounting principles are a series of rules that guide companies on how to prepare their financial statements. They explain how transactions, such as sales, purchases, and payments, should be reported. Before accounting principles were introduced, companies were free to record and report financial data as they saw fit. This made financial statements harder to compare and made it far easier for companies to skew their numbers positively. For investors and regulators, it was a nightmare.\n The roots of modern accounting principles trace back to the Stock Market Crash of 1929 and the subsequent Great Depression. Before then, companies had free rein to report their finances however they wished, often hiding losses and inflating profits through creative bookkeeping. In the aftermath of the crash, as investigators uncovered widespread accounting manipulation that had helped fuel speculation, Congress passed the Securities Acts of 1933 and 1934 to protect investors. These laws established the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and mandated standardized financial reporting for public companies. During the same decade, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) worked with the SEC to develop the first formal accounting standards. In many other countries, these guidelines fall to the IFRS, established by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB). The Core Principles  Here is a list of the most common accounting principles:\n Conservatism Principle  Expenses and liabilities should be recognized as soon as possible, even if uncertainty exists, while revenues and assets should only be recognized if they are certain. The goal is to be open about future losses and cautious about acknowledging future gains.\n Consistency Principle  Once a company adopts an accounting principle or method, it should stick to it so that future changes are easily compared.\n Cost Principle  An asset, liability, or equity investment\u00a0must be recorded at its original purchase cost.\n Economic Entity Principle  The financial transactions of a company and its owners should be separate and thus report separate accounting records and bank accounts for each.\n Full Disclosure Principle  Companies must reveal all relevant and material information in their financial statements. For example, if there were significant write-downs, a breakdown of how depreciation was calculated should be provided.\n Going Concern Principle  Companies are able to defer the recognition of some expenses, such as depreciation, to later periods because it is assumed they will continue to operate in the future.\n Matching Principle  All expenses related to a revenue-generating transaction should be recorded at the time the revenue is recognized. That is, you can't boost your supposed profits by recording your gains at one time and the costs to get them at another.\n Materiality Principle  All information deemed reasonably likely to impact investors\u2019 decision-making should be reported in detail in a company\u2019s financial statements.\n Monetary Unit Principle  Financial statements should only record things that can be expressed in terms of a currency. This principle prevents companies from inflating their numbers with overly optimistic estimations for aspects of a business that are hard to ascribe value to, such as employee quality.\n Objectivity Principle  Accounting should be based on facts and objective evidence and free of bias and personal opinion.\u00a0\n Reliability Principle  Only transactions supported by evidence, such as a receipt or invoice, should be recorded.\n Revenue Recognition Principle  Revenues should be recognized on the income statement in the period they are realized and earned\u2014not necessarily when the cash is received. Time Period Principle  Companies should report their financial activities over a standard time period, such as quarterly or annually.\n Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP)  GAAP are the accounting principles that all regulated U.S. entities, including publicly traded companies, government agencies, and nonprofits, must follow. These rules were set and are periodically revised by the\u00a0Financial Accounting Standards Board, an independent nonprofit organization whose members are chosen by the\u00a0Financial Accounting Foundation. Compliance is verified by an external audit conducted by a certified public accountant. Companies often accompany GAAP-compliant measures with non-GAAP figures in their financial statements. When a figure is non-GAAP, the company must say so and investors should pay heed to that fact. International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS)  IFRS standards are used in 168 jurisdictions, including the European Union, the U.K., Canada, India, Russia, South Korea, South Africa, and Chile.\u00a0The standards are issued and maintained by the IASB, an independent, private-sector body headquartered in London. The IFRS\u2019s 17 standards cover everything from how a company should recognize revenues from contracts to accounting for insurance contracts and leases. These rules are underpinned by four core principles: clarity, relevance, reliability, and comparability. The type of entities IFRS is enforced on depends on the country or territory. In the EU, for example, all companies are required to conform. Meanwhile, in other countries, the IFRS might be compulsory for only certain types of companies, like banks or those over a certain valuation.WarningInvestors should be cautious when comparing the financial statements of companies from different countries as not all accounting principles are the same. IFRS Vs. GAAP  While GAAP and IFRS have differences, they share the same core goal that emerged from the 1930s reforms\u2014protecting investors through transparency and consistency. IFRS is principles-based, while GAAP (despite the name) is rules-based. The former leaves greater room for interpretation, while the latter dictates exactly how financial statements should be prepared. They also differ in how they want companies to record and report certain transactions, including the formatting of balance sheets and the treatment of interest, asset revaluations, inventory, intangibles, research and development expenses, liabilities, and revenue. For example, GAAP permits using last-in, first-out inventory accounting methods but doesn\u2019t allow for inventory reversals, while IFRS has banned the former but allows the latter under certain conditions. The Bottom Line  Accounting principles ensure companies are as transparent, consistent, and objective as possible when reporting their financials and that all metrics and valuation approaches used are the same. For investors, this results in all financial statements being similar and consequently easier to understand, analyze, and compare.\n Accounting principles vary by region. However, they generally share the same fundamentals and objectives, which include being conservative about estimating income and forthcoming about expenses.\n", "tags": ["www.investopedia.com", "terms", "wwwinvestopediacom"]}

Irregular items are occurrences unrelated to a business's operational and financial results.\u00a0\nKey TakeawaysCompanies identify unusual or infrequent items on a financial statement to separate income or expenses unrelated to the core business.Irregular items can include damage from natural disasters and restructuring costs.GAAP rules report infrequent transactions on the income statement or disclose them in the financial statement footnotes.IFRS rules report unusual transactions as revenues, finance costs, post-tax gains or losses, or results from associates and joint ventures. Types of Unusual or Infrequent Items  Some items on income statements are reported separately from income because they are considered irregular and nonrecurring. Special considerations are given to so-called unusual or infrequent items to clarify rare circumstances to investors or regulators about a firm's current or future financial performance. Examples of unusual items include:\nGains or losses from a lawsuitLosses or slowdown of operations due to natural disastersRestructuring costsGains or losses from the sale of assetsCosts associated with acquiring another businessLosses from the early retirement of debtPlant shutdown costs U.S. GAAP  GAAP rules require companies to disclose infrequent and unusual events. Under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, a nonrecurring item can only be classified as unusual or infrequent, but not as both.\n The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) mandates that companies report unusual or infrequent transactions on the income statement or disclosed in their financial statement footnotes.ImportantUnder GAAP, unusual events were once considered extraordinary items separated from operating earnings. As of 2015, infrequent items are disclosed separately in the income statement to define their impact on the company's financial picture.\u00a0 IFRS  The IFRS does not hold distinctions for items of an operational nature that occur irregularly or infrequently. All results are disclosed as revenues, finance costs, post-tax gains or losses, or results from associates and joint ventures. The IFRS has a separate disclosure requirement for income or expenses of abnormal size or nature. These disclosures can be on the face of the income statement or in the notes section of the report.Fast FactThe IFRS maintains the global accounting standards of 168 jurisdictions including the U.S. and countries in the European Union.What Was the Designation \"Extraordinary Items\" Eliminated?Many items reported as irregular or unusual used to be classified as extraordinary items, however, GAAP no longer requires this classification to reduce the cost and complexity of financial statements. Extraordinary items were explained in the notes to the financial statements separately from operating earnings.Why Do Companies Report Unusual Items?It is important to report unusual or infrequent items separately to help ensure the transparency of financial reporting as they are not considered part of normal business operations.How Does the Treatment of Infrequent Items Affect Investors?Reporting unusual or infrequent items provides clarity to investors and analysts that these income and expenses are not part of the core operations and therefore not likely to occur again. This helps investors and analysts make better judgments on the future performance of a business. The Bottom Line  The two accounting standards, GAAP and IFRS, approach reporting unusual or infrequent items in slightly different fashions, however, both no longer use the classification of extraordinary items for simplicity. Both standards require the items to be included in either the income statement or the notes to the financial statements.\n", "tags": ["www.investopedia.com", "ask", "wwwinvestopediacom"]}

Accounts still have to track these exchanges but they can't rely on standard purchase receipts to record the transaction.\n Accounting standards differ in the U.S. versus internationally but barter transactions are typically accounted for using various methods that result in a fair value estimate.\nKey TakeawaysBarter exchange takes place when an entity provides a good or service and receives a good or service rather than money in return.Accounts still have to track these exchanges but they can't rely on standard purchase receipts to record the transactions.Recognizing revenue requires that a reliable estimate should be provided for nonmonetary sales according to IFRS standards.U.S. GAAP also holds that a fair market value estimate based on prior, non-barter transactions should be performed to record a barter sale. IFRS and Barter Transactions  The International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) are accounting rules for reporting accounting transactions and entries within financial statements for companies outside the U.S. The rules are established and updated by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB). These accounting guidelines help to create transparent and consistent accounting practices that benefit companies and investors.\n Revenue can be cash, receivables, or other assets according to IFRS standards, The standards for recognizing revenue require that a reliable estimate should be provided for nonmonetary sales. No barter sale can be recognized without such a measurement per International Accounting Standard 18,\n Most contemporary bartering occurs for trades between advertising services. The IASB issued a specific ruling detailed in SIC-31, Revenue\u2013Barter Transactions Involving Advertising Services, as a result. Businesses exchange ad time or ad space for other ad time or ad space in these cases. SIC-31 provides a framework for applying fair market value to advertising services. The basic process involves analyzing previous, non-barter transactions that involved similar advertising services. Per IFRS guidelines, these non-barter transactions can only be used if they occur frequently and don't involve a third party that was also used in the barter exchange.\n U.S. GAAP and Barter Transactions  The accounting standards that companies must adhere to in the U.S. are called Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) is charged with establishing and maintaining GAAP in the United States.\n A barter transaction is defined under the U.S. GAAP system as two parties exchanging goods or services without cash payment. The overwhelming majority of these barters involve advertising services much like with IFRS. U.S. GAAP also looks for a fair market value estimate based on prior non-barter transactions to record a barter sale. The historical revenue from similar transactions of goods and services can be used to help establish fair market value.\n The primary difference between GAAP and the SIC-31 is that GAAP has a way of accounting for circumstances where a fair market value can't be successfully estimated. Under the ruling made by the Emerging Issues Task Force in 1999, the revenue from a barter transaction is recorded at the carrying value of the asset given up, which is most likely valued at zero, if no estimation of historical data is available.\nImportantThe item recorded is called Nonmonetary Transaction, Amount of Barter Transaction in the first case. It's recorded as Nonmonetary Transaction, Fair Value Not Determinable in the latter case. Barter Credits and Third-Party Barter Exchanges  These descriptions don't cover transactions through third-party barter exchanges where individuals or businesses trade commodities in exchange for barter credits or \"points\" to be used later.\n The points act as an informal medium of exchange and these aren't direct transactions so they're a separate issue from traditional barter transactions. GAAP allows for standard revenue recognition in such cases of a transaction that involves barter credits and the barter credits are readily exchangeable for a cash instrument.\nWhat Is a Carrying Value?A carrying value is the difference between what an asset initially cost less its depreciation. Not all assets can be depreciated.How Common Is Bartering in the U.S.?It's been reported that almost half a million companies participate in barter in the U.S. They exchange more than $10 million in annual transactions. Most take place through barter services.What Is Fair Market Value?Fair market value is the price at which a buyer and seller agree to make a transaction without any undue influence and with a full understanding of the asset's marketability and condition. The Bottom Line  A barter exchange occurs when parties exchange a good or service without cash or other monetary payment. Businesses must nonetheless record these transactions in their books even without monetary receipts. Both GAAP and IFRS provide accounting techniques for the process but their rules differ. The best option for your company can depend on the exact details of your barter transactions.\n", "tags": ["www.investopedia.com", "ask", "wwwinvestopediacom"]}
{"url": "https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/052015/how-does-inventory-accounting-differ-between-gaap-and-ifrs.asp", "title": "How Does Inventory Accounting Differ Between GAAP and IFRS?", "text": " While companies in the United States operate under the generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), most other countries use the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). There are many differences between both systems, particularly in how they treat inventory accounting.\n One of the most basic differences is that GAAP permits the use of all three of the most common methods for inventory accountability\u2014weighted-average cost method;\u00a0first in, first out\u00a0(FIFO); and\u00a0last in, first out\u00a0(LIFO)\u2014while the IFRS forbids the use of the LIFO method. GAAP and IFRS also differ on inventory reversal write-downs and costing formulas.\n Though these two systems are different in many ways, they have some similarities in their approach to inventory costing. For example, inventory expenses must include all direct costs to ready inventory for sale, including overhead, and must exclude selling costs and most general administrative costs.\n Let's take a look at some of the key differences between GAAP and IFRS's treatment of inventory accounting.\nKey TakeawaysCompanies in the United States operate under the generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), while most other countries use the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS).GAAP permits the use of all three of the most common methods for inventory accountability; the IFRS forbids the use of the LIFO method.IFRS requires that inventory is carried at the lower of cost or net realizable value; U.S. GAAP requires that inventory is carried at the lower of cost or market\u00a0value.IFRS allows for some inventory reversal write-downs; GAAP does not. Inventory Valuation  Under GAAP, inventory is recorded as the lesser of cost or\u00a0net asset value (NAV)\u00a0under FIFO. According to the\u00a0Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), the organization responsible for interpreting and modifying GAAP, as of 2017 this method should be used instead of using\u00a0replacement cost. The IFRS lays down slightly different costing rules. It states that inventory is measured as the lesser of cost or net realizable value.\n This is a subtle distinction because both entities use the phrase \"net realizable value\" to mean slightly different things. The IFRS's definition of net realizable value is equal to the estimated selling price minus any reasonable costs associated with a sale. For GAAP, net realizable value is the best approximation of how much \"inventories are expected to realize.\" Reversal of Inventory Write-Downs  Both systems require that inventory be written down as soon as its cost is higher than its net realizable value. In a sense, this means the inventory is \"underwater.\"\n Sometimes the net realizable value changes and adjusts back up; meaning, for some reason, the inventory assets have appreciated in value. The IFRS allows for reversals to be made and subsequent increases in value to be recognized in financial statements. These reversals must be recognized in the period in which they occur and are limited to the amount of the original write-down. In contrast, GAAP prohibits reversals altogether. Accounting Methods for Inventory Costs  According to accounting standards Code 330-10-30-9 under GAAP, a company should focus on the accounting method that best and most clearly reflect \"periodic income.\" This provides considerable leeway for companies to maximize their after-tax revenues based on inventory costs.\n International standards are very different. Unless specifically exempted as \"not ordinarily interchangeable and goods or services produced and segregated for specific projects,\" all inventory must be accounted for using the FIFO or weighted-average cost method. The method selected must remain consistent. According to IAS 2, \u201can entity shall use the same cost formula for all inventories having a similar nature and use to the entity.\" Convergence  Because of the confusion that can arise between the differences between the IFRS and GAAP, accounting bodies in the U.S. and elsewhere have expressed a desire to converge accounting rules between the two systems. It is likely that such convergence efforts will remove the use of LIFO costing in the U.S. and create a more consistent definition of net realizable value, among other significant accounting changes.", "tags": ["www.investopedia.com", "ask", "wwwinvestopediacom"]}
{"url": "https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/csrs.asp", "title": "Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS): What It Is, How It Works", "text": " What Is the Civil Service Retirement System?  The Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS)\u00a0is a system that provided retirement, disability, and survivor benefits for most U.S. civilian service employees working for the federal government. It was replaced in 1987 by the Federal Employees Retirement System (FERS).\n However, employees who were originally set up through the CSRS still receive their benefits through that program, unless they were hired after 1983.Key TakeawaysCSRS is a pension plan for federal employees that was created in 1920.It provides a generous lifetime annuity to civil servants after retirement, based on their age, average salary, and years of service.In 1987, Congress created the Federal Employees Retirement System (FERS) to replace CSRS.All new federal employees will receive their benefits from FERS.FERS offers a smaller annuity than CSRS, but it can be supplemented with social security, which CSRS employees are not eligible for. Understanding the Civil Service Retirement System  CSRS was created in 1920, with the goal of offering government employees a retirement benefit comparable to the pensions that were offered in the private sector. Career civil servants were eligible for a generous lifetime annuity, calculated based on their age and the length of their service. However, CSRS preceded the establishment of social security as a default retirement benefit for all Americans. When the Social Security Administration was set up in 1935, federal employees were ineligible for benefits, because of the annuity they received under CSRS. This changed in 1986 when President Reagan established FERS. This new retirement plan was intended to cover all federal employees hired after 1983. Although the benefits were smaller than those offered by CSRS, these employees were also eligible for social security benefits, as well as a matching contribution to a federal Thrift Savings Plan (TSP). All civil servants hired prior to 1983 were given the option of switching over to the FERS system. Today, the only remaining employees covered by CSRS are those who chose not to switch.\n Types of Retirement Under CSRS  The CSRS provides five types of benefits for retired employees: optional retirement, disability retirement, discontinued service retirement, special/early optional retirement, and special provision retirement. Each of them has different conditions, but an employee is only eligible for benefits after five years of full-time service. Optional Retirement  Optional retirement is available to civil servants who meet certain conditions relating to their age or length of service. There are three different combinations. An employee can retire at 55, provided they have served at least thirty years in the civil service, but a 60-year-old can retire with only 20 years of service. The minimum length of service is five years, allowing retirement after age 62.\n Disability Retirement Disability retirement is available to federal employees who become disabled in a manner that makes them unable to continue their service. In addition to the five-year minimum, these employees must also meet stringent requirements for medical documentation to prove disability.\n1.6%The percentage of federal employees covered by CSRS as of fiscal year 2022. The rest\u201498.4%\u2014 were covered under the new plan, FERS. Discontinued Service Retirement-Involuntary  This refers to individuals whose employment ends because their positions are eliminated or made redundant. In order to be eligible, the employee must have served 25 years, or just 20 if they are at least 50 years old. In addition, their removal cannot be related to misconduct or delinquency.\n Special/Early Optional Retirement  This is for employees whose agencies undergo a significant reorganization or reduction in force. It is available after 25 years of service, or 20 years if the employee is over 50. However, the employee's annuity is reduced if they retire before age 50.\n Special Provision Retirement  This type of retirement is only available to certain specialized careers, such as air traffic controllers, Supreme Court Police, Capitol Police, or nuclear materials couriers. Employees in these careers are eligible for retirement after age 50 and at least twenty years of service. Air traffic controllers can retire earlier, if they have served at least 25 years.\n CSRS vs. FERS  CSRS was founded in 1920 to provide civil servants with a pension, similar to that enjoyed by private sector employees. Because the social security system had not yet been introduced, CSRS was intended to provide annuity payments to all government employees after the conclusion of their service.\n The Federal Employees Retirement System (FERS) was launched in 1987 to replace CSRS. All federal employees hired after 1983 were automatically enrolled in the new plan, and those hired earlier were given the option to voluntarily change to FERS.\n Today, CSRS serves the small number of federal employees hired before 1983 who chose not to enroll with FERS, as well as all of its current annuitants.\n The main difference between the two systems is that CSRS provides a larger benefit than FERS, and deducts a larger share of the employee's paycheck. CSRS employees pay 7% of their salary into the civil service retirement fund, while FERS employees pay up to 4.4%, depending on their date of hire. Although the FERS benefit is less generous than that from CSRS, FERS-covered employees also receive up to a 5% matching contribution to their TSP.What Is the Average CSRS Pension?The average monthly CSRS annuity payment in fiscal year 2022 (the latest report) was about $5,447 per month.Is CSRS a Lifetime Annuity?Yes, CSRS provides a lifetime annuity, meaning that payments will continue as long as the beneficiary is alive. Upon their death, the beneficiary's heirs may be eligible for a lump-sum payment equivalent to the unpaid remainder of their pension.How Many CSRS Employees Are Left?As of 2022, about 1.6% of active federal employees were enrolled in CSRS, a figure equivalent to about 44,000 workers. This number will continue to decline as more federal employees retire.How Much Is the CSRS Death Benefit?CSRS provides a survivor benefit equivalent to 55% of the employee's unreduced annual benefit to the employee's surviving spouse or child. If the heirs are not eligible for survivor's benefits, they may receive a lump-sum payment equal to the employee's total contributions to their CSRS retirement plan.Can CSRS Beneficiaries Collect Social Security?Federal employees who chose to stay in CSRS do not have money deducted from their paychecks for social security, and they do not earn social security benefits through their federal employment. However, some CSRS employees may be eligible for other social security benefits, either through a spouse, or through other employment prior to their federal service.Do CSRS Retirees Get Medicare?Yes. All federal employees pay 1.45% of their gross income into Medicare, regardless of whether they are enrolled in CSRS or FERS. As a result, they are eligible for Medicare benefits, like any other retiree. The Bottom Line  The Civil Service Retirement System is a pension plan for government workers that was replaced in 1987 by the Federal Employees Retirement System. Active federal employees who were hired in 1983 or before will receive their benefits through CSRS.\n As of fiscal year 2022, 44,000 active government employees were covered by CSRS. FERS covered 2,788,000.", "tags": ["www.investopedia.com", "terms", "wwwinvestopediacom"]}

The International Bank of Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) is a development bank administered by the World Bank. It offers financial products and policy advice to countries aiming to reduce poverty and promote sustainable development. The IBRD is a global cooperative owned by 189 member countries.Key TakeawaysThe International Bank of Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) is one of two major institutions administered by the World Bank.\u00a0It was established in 1944 at the Bretton Woods Conference.The first loan it made was to France to help it rebuild its infrastructure, which was destroyed during World War II.The IBRD advises middle-income countries and creditworthy low-income countries that seek to build financial well-being, limit poverty, and enable sustainable development.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In addition to advice, it offers financing to support projects that can help countries achieve greater prosperity. Understanding the International Bank of Reconstruction and Development (IBRD)  The IBRD was founded in anticipation of the end of World War II, during the Bretton Woods Conference of 1944, a gathering of the 44 allied nations of the Second World War meant to establish the post-war global financial order. Its goal was to help war-torn European countries rebuild their infrastructures and economies. The International Monetary Fund was also formed at the conference. Following the recovery from World War II, the IBRD broadened its mandate to help increase global economic growth and eliminate poverty.\n The IBRD is one of two major institutions administered by the World Bank. The other is the International Development Association (IDA). The IDA is a financial institution dedicated to making developmental loans to the world\u2019s poorest countries.\n Middle-Income Countries  Today, the IBRD focuses its services and efforts on middle-income countries and creditworthy low-income countries. For fiscal year 2024, middle-income countries are those with a per capita gross national income ranging from $4,466 to $13,845 per year. The IBRD adjusts these and other figures yearly to account for inflation, economic changes within middle-income countries, and other factors.\n These middle-income countries, such as Indonesia, India, and Thailand, are often home to fast-growing economies that attract a lot of foreign investment and large infrastructure building projects.\n Challenges Countries Face  At the same time, middle-income countries are home to 75% of the world\u2019s population and 62% of the world's poor people. The benefits of this economic growth are unevenly distributed across their populations. The success of middle-income countries is precarious, as many economies that look promising may collapse under the weight of corruption and economic mismanagement.\u00a0\n So the goal of the IBRD is to provide financing and economic policy advice to help the leaders of middle-income countries navigate the path toward greater prosperity.\n The institution will often help finance infrastructure projects that grow a country\u2019s economic potential, help governments manage public finances, and cultivate the confidence of foreign investors. Services Offered by the IBRD  To achieve its goal of providing essential advice and financial assistance, the IBRD offers a range of support:\nFinancial solutions such as loans, guarantees, and risk management toolsAdvisory and knowledge services for governments at the national and municipal levels to help strengthen policies and public institutionsTechnical support throughout individual projectsPublic debt and asset management advisory assistance to help countries learn to protect and enlarge their financial resourcesPublic financial management advisory support IBRD Financing  To provide financial assistance to middle-income countries, the IBRD raises funds in the financial markets. Since 1946, it has loaned over $500 billion.\n Its triple-A credit rating, sustained since 1959, gives it access to low-cost financing, which in turn lets it provide loans with favorable terms to the developing countries that it serves. It earns income from its return on equity and small lending margin, some of which it provides every year to the IDA to loan to poorer nations.Why Does the IBRD Focus on Middle-Income Countries?Middle-income countries are the focus of its mission because these are nations with huge potential for successful economic growth but a sizeable percentage of poverty, that already have infrastructure investments, and that receive large amounts of exported goods from other countries.What's an Example of an IBRD Project?The Peru Sierra Irrigation Subsector project is one example of many. The Sierra area of Peru is an agricultural sector that experiences severe poverty. The IBRD provided a loan of $20 million and substantial advisory support to modernize irrigation systems, improve irrigation technology, increase irrigation capacity, and formalize water rights. The better irrigation allowed farmers not only to grow more crops but also to change over to crops with greater market value.Does the U.S. Own the IBRD?No, but it is one of the 189 member nations of the cooperative that does own it. The U.S. is the largest shareholder of the organization, with 15.8% of voting rights. The Bottom Line  The International Bank of Reconstruction and Development is a World Bank institution owned by a cooperative of 189 countries around the world. Its mission is to support developing countries with financial products and advisory services to help them achieve greater prosperity, reduce poverty, and engage in the sustainable development of resources.\n", "tags": ["www.investopedia.com", "terms", "wwwinvestopediacom"]}

International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS)\u00a0are a set of accounting rules for the financial statements of public companies that are intended to make them consistent, transparent, and easily comparable around the world.\n IFRS currently has complete profiles for 168 jurisdictions, including those in the European Union. The United States uses a different system, the generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The IFRS is issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB).\n The IFRS system is sometimes confused with the International Accounting Standards (IAS), which are the older standards that the IFRS replaced in 2001.Key TakeawaysInternational Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) were created to bring consistency and integrity to accounting standards and practices, regardless of the company or the country.They were issued by the London-based Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and address record keeping, account reporting, and other aspects of financial reporting.The IFRS system replaced the International Accounting Standards (IAS) in 2001.IFRS fosters greater corporate transparency.IFRS are not used by all countries; for example, the U.S. uses generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).Investopedia / Paige McLaughlin Understanding International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS)  IFRS specify in detail how companies must maintain their records and report their expenses and income. They were established to create a common accounting language that could be understood globally by investors, auditors, government regulators, and other interested parties.\n The standards are designed to bring consistency to accounting language, practices, and statements, and to help businesses and investors make educated financial analyses and decisions.\n They were developed by the International Accounting Standards Board, which is part of the not-for-profit, London-based IFRS Foundation. The Foundation says it sets the standards to \u201cbring transparency, accountability, and efficiency to financial markets around the world.\" IFRS vs. GAAP  Public companies in the U.S. are required to use a rival system, the generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The GAAP standards were developed by the Financial Standards Accounting Board (FSAB) and the Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB).\n The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has said it won't switch to International Financial Reporting Standards but will continue reviewing a proposal to allow IFRS information to supplement U.S. financial filings. There are differences between IFRS and GAAP reporting. For example, IFRS is not as strict in defining revenue and allows companies to report revenue sooner. A balance sheet using this system might show a higher stream of revenue than a GAAP version of the same balance sheet.\n IFRS\u00a0also has different requirements for reporting expenses. For example, if a company is spending money on development or on investment for the future, it doesn't necessarily have to be reported as an expense. It can be capitalized instead. Standard IFRS Requirements  IFRS covers a wide range of accounting activities. There are certain aspects of business practice for which IFRS set mandatory rules.\nStatement of financial position: This is the balance sheet. IFRS influences the ways in which the components of a balance sheet are reported.Statement of comprehensive income: This can take the form of one statement or be separated into a profit and loss statement and a statement of other income, including property and equipment.Statement of changes in equity: Also known as a statement of retained earnings, this documents the company's change in earnings or profit for the given financial period.Statement of cash flows: This report summarizes the company's financial transactions in the given period, separating cash flow into operations, investing, and financing. In addition to these basic reports, a company must give a summary of its accounting policies. The full report is often seen side by side with the previous report to show the changes in profit and loss. A parent company must create separate account reports for each of its subsidiary companies.NoteChinese companies do not use IFRS or GAAP. They use Chinese Accounting Standards for Business Enterprises (ASBEs). History of IFRS  IFRS originated in the European Union with the intention of making business affairs and accounts accessible across the continent. It was quickly adopted as a common accounting language.\n Although the U.S. and some other countries don't use IFRS, currently 168 jurisdictions do, making IFRS the most-used set of standards globally.Who Uses IFRS?IFRS is required to be used by public companies based in 168 jurisdictions, including all of the nations in the European Union as well as Canada, India, Russia, South Korea, South Africa, and Chile. The U.S. and China each have their own systems.How Does IFRS Differ From GAAP?The two systems have the same goal: clarity and honesty in financial reporting by publicly-traded companies. IFRS was designed as a standards-based approach that could be used internationally. GAAP is a rules-based system used primarily in the U.S.Although most of the world uses IFRS standards, it is still not part of the U.S. financial accounting world. The SEC continues to review switching to the IFRS but has yet to do so.Several methodological differences exist between the two systems. For instance, GAAP allows a company to use either of two inventory cost methods: First in, First out (FIFO) or Last in, First out (LIFO). LIFO, however, is banned under IFRS.Why Is IFRS Important?IFRS fosters transparency and trust in the global financial markets and the companies that list their shares on them. If such standards did not exist, investors would be more reluctant to believe the financial statements and other information presented to them by companies. Without that trust, we might see fewer transactions and a less robust economy.IFRS also helps investors analyze companies by making it easier to perform \u201capples to apples\u201d comparisons between one company and another, and for fundamental analysis of a company's performance. The Bottom Line  The International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) are accounting rules for public companies with the goal of making company financial statements consistent, transparent, and easily comparable around the world. This helps with auditing, tax purposes, and investing.\n", "tags": ["www.investopedia.com", "terms", "wwwinvestopediacom"]}
{"url": "https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/isda-master-agreement.asp", "title": "ISDA Master Agreement: Definition, What It Does, and Requirements", "text": " Published by the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA), an ISDA master agreement is a standardized contract for over-the-counter (OTC) derivative transactions. It's the lingua franca of the derivatives world, used extensively by financial institutions, corporations, and other market participants.\n The agreement provides prearranged terms, conditions, and forms of documentation, including payment arrangements and schedule, what happens if there's a default, what counts as termination events, and credit dealings. The ISDA master agreement is standardized but has customized schedules and sometimes a credit support annex that can be adjusted by the parties.\nKey TakeawaysAn ISDA master agreement is a standardized document regularly used in over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives transactions.OTC derivatives are traded between two parties, not through an exchange or intermediary.The agreement covers crucial areas such as payment netting, events of default, termination events, representations, and credit support arrangements, serving as an umbrella contract for all future OTC derivative transactions between the parties.The agreement allows OTC derivative transactions to be netted against each other in the event of default, reducing credit exposure and systemic risk.The advantages of using ISDA master agreements include improved transparency and more liquidity (the ability to find counterparties in this area of trading). How an ISDA Master Agreement Works  While futures and most options are fully standardized and traded on exchanges like the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, OTC derivatives are just between two parties, not through an exchange or intermediary. Risk managers must carefully oversee traders and ensure approved transactions are correctly managed. When two parties enter a transaction, they each receive a confirmation setting out details and references to the signed agreement. The terms of the ISDA master agreement then cover the transaction. The original ISDA master agreement was created to standardize these trades in 1985. It was revised in 1992 and again in 2002. Here are the types of derivatives for which they are used:\nInterest rate derivatives (e.g. interest rate swaps, caps, floors, swaptions)Credit derivatives (e.g. credit default swaps)Equity derivatives (e.g. equity swaps, options, forwards)Foreign exchange derivatives (e.g. currency swaps, forwards, options)Commodity derivatives (e.g. commodity swaps, options, forwards) The ISDA master agreement makes transaction closeout and netting easier since it bridges the gap between various standards used in different jurisdictions. Below is the data on global derivatives trading since 2019. The chart is telling about what kinds of derivatives are traded OTC, since equities, commodities, and credit derivatives, popular exchange-traded contracts, are subsumed under \"other\" in the chart, and forex and interest rate derivatives are far more at issue in these contracts.\n Most multinational banks have ISDA master agreements in place with one another. These agreements usually cover all branches that are active in foreign exchange, interest rate, or options trading. Banks require corporate counterparties to sign an agreement to enter into swaps. Some also require agreements for foreign exchange transactions.\n While the ISDA master agreement is standard, its terms and conditions are amended and defined in its schedules. The latter are negotiated to cover either the requirements of a specific hedging transaction or an ongoing trading relationship.\n A credit support annex (CSA) sometimes accompanies the master agreement. The CSA allows the two parties involved to mitigate their credit risk by stipulating the terms and conditions under which they're required to post collateral for each other.\nImportantISDA master agreements are used by firms worldwide. Benefits of an ISDA Master Agreement  The most significant advantages of an ISDA master agreement are that it improves transparency and provides higher liquidity, that is, an easier ability to trade in derivatives worldwide, knowing there are standardized terms available. In addition, clarifying the terms in the agreement saves time and legal fees for everyone involved.\n Requirements of an ISDA Master Agreement  The master agreement and schedule set out the grounds under which a party can force the closeout of covered transactions because of a termination event by the other party. Standard termination events include failure to pay or bankruptcy. Other termination events, including credit downgrades, can be added to the schedule.\n The ISDA master agreement also specifies whether the laws of the U.K. New York state, or some other jurisdiction apply. It also sets out the terms for valuing, closing out, and netting all covered transactions in case of a termination event.\n Netting in the ISDA Master Agreement Netting is a key feature of the ISDA master agreement. It's a way to offset or consolidate different payment obligations between two parties into a single net payment. Instead of each party making separate payments for each individual transaction, the amounts due are calculated and combined, resulting in a single payment from one party to the other.\n For example, if Party A owes Party B $1,000,000 for one derivative transaction, and Party B owes Party A $800,000 for another transaction, these obligations can be netted against each other. The result would be a single payment of $200,000 from Party A to Party B.\n The ISDA master agreement allowance of netting is particularly important if there's a default. By netting the transactions, the overall credit exposure is reduced since the parties only need to settle the net amount rather than each individual transaction separately. Thus, netting helps to mitigate counterparty risk and simplify cash flows.\n ISDA Master Agreement Example  Imagine that two companies, ABC Inc. and XYZ Corp. are in international finance. Each is located in a different country and wishes to trade OTC derivatives with each other.\n ABC Inc. and XYZ Corp. could sign an ISDA master agreement based on the standard document. This agreement would set down provisions for how the two companies will handle these transactions, including what laws will apply and how the companies will close out the trades they make.\n If there is a disagreement between the two companies about one or more trades, they will settle the disagreement using the laws specified in the agreement and based on the terms included in the ISDA master agreement.\nWho Uses ISDA Master Agreements?ISDA master agreements are most commonly used by international financial companies, but they can be used by others. Some ultra-high-net-worth individuals use these agreements to trade.How Can One of the Parties End an ISDA Master Agreement?Each ISDA master agreement has provisions that specify how one or both parties can cancel the agreement. They also include events that will automatically end the agreement, such as one party entering default.Are ISDA Master Agreements Also Called Hunting Licenses?Yes. The term \"hunting license\" was used to describe ISDA master agreements in Michael Lewis's The Big Short. This refers to the massive market for OTC derivatives and how these agreements give some investors the chance to make high-level trades unavailable to most. The Bottom Line  The ISDA master agreement is a standardized document created by the ISDA for OTC derivatives transactions. It provides a framework for the terms and conditions for trading OTC derivatives, helping to cut legal and credit risks by establishing consistent documentation across different jurisdictions and many trades.\n The major parts of the ISDA master agreement include the schedule, which allows parties to customize certain terms, and the CSA, which details the collateral arrangements. The master agreement also addresses issues like dispute resolution, the governing law, and tax considerations. In addition, it helps to manage counterparty risk since it ensures that both parties understand their rights and obligations.\n", "tags": ["www.investopedia.com", "terms", "wwwinvestopediacom"]}
{"url": "https://www.investopedia.com/articles/economics/12/impact-gaap-ifrs-convergence.asp", "title": "Gauging the Impact of Combining GAAP and IFRS", "text": " Countries like the United States are feeling the pressure to eliminate the gap between the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and the U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). This pressure is coming from globalization, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX), and the Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC)\u00a0adoption of international standards.\n Such initiatives have consequences on the world of accounting diversity. The convergence of GAAP along with the IFRS largely impacts corporate management, investors, stock markets, accounting professionals, and accounting standards setters. It also changes the attitudes of certified public accountants (CPAs) and chief financial officers (CFOs) toward the harmonization of international accounting, affecting the quality of the international accounting standards and the efforts made toward the goal of convergence of GAAP and IFRS standards.\nKey TakeawaysOne major difference between GAAP and IFRS is their methodology, with GAAP being rules-based and the latter being principles-based.This difference has posed a challenge in areas such as consolidation, the income statement, inventory, the earnings-per-share calculation, and development costs.IFRS favors a control model whereas the U.S. GAAP prefers a risk-and-reward model.It could be difficult for GAAP users to try another format, especially when the change could require learning a whole new system of financial accounting.\u00a0 GAAP vs. IFRS: An Overview  The main difference between the GAAP and the IFRS is one of approach:\nGAAP is rule-based and consists of a complex set of guidelines attempting to establish rules and criteria for any contingency.IFRS is a principles-based methodology that begins with the objectives of good reporting and then provides guidance on how the specific objective relates to a given situation. Not every country uses the same accounting and reporting standards. For instance, the U.S. is the only country that uses GAAP while countries that use IFRS include. Canada, China, India, and the United Kingdom, among others. This creates inconsistencies for both investors and lenders. Investors\u00a0may come across issues when they consider funding capital-seeking companies that follow the accounting standards and financial reporting of the country in which they do business. Similarly, lenders may find it hard to determine a company's financial health and well-being of two companies that don't follow the same standards.\n The main issues with convergence lie with the difference in the approach of the U.S. GAAP and IFRS. The IFRS is more dynamic and is continuously being revised in response to an ever-changing financial environment. SEC'S Goals for Convergence  The Securities and Exchange Commission's goals and efforts have been to consistently pursue the achievement of fair, liquid, and efficient capital markets. The aim is to provide investors with information that is accurate, timely, comparable, and reliable. One of the ways the SEC has pursued these goals is by upholding the domestic quality of financial reporting as well as encouraging the convergence of the U.S. and IFRS standards. Research indicates that firms that apply the international standards show the following:\nA higher variance of net income changesA higher change in cash flowsA significantly lower negative correlation between accruals and cash flowsA lower frequency of small positive incomeA higher frequency of large negative incomeA higher value relevance in accounting amounts They also have fewer earnings management, more timely loss recognition, and more value relevance in accounting amounts compared to domestic firms following the GAAP. Therefore, firms adhering to the IFRS generally exhibit higher accounting quality than when they previously followed the GAAP. Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB)'s Role in Convergence  The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) states that the Sarbanes-Oxley Act's requirement of the SEC to investigate the feasibility of implementing a more principles-based approach to accounting means that the U.S. needs to continue its compliance with the SOX as part of the process of the convergence of the GAAP and IFRS standards.\n Both FASB and IFRS have identified short- and long-term convergence projects, including 20 reporting areas where differences have been resolved and completed. The FASB also provides clarification on the GAAP by categorizing it in descending order of authority. The appeal of convergence is based on the fact that the convergence of accounting standards can best be achieved over time through the development of high-quality, common standards. It is also attractive because eliminating standards on either side is counterproductive. Therefore, new common standards that improve the financial information reported to stakeholders should be developed. Despite the research-indicated evidence of a higher accounting quality being experienced by firms that either apply the IFRS standards or have switched to them from the GAAP, the\u00a0convergence process has not proven to be an easy task, mostly because of the differences in approach between the two accounting bodies. A solution may be that the IFRS should accept some FASB standards to accommodate the needs of the U.S. constituents and stakeholders.ImportantThe Financial Accounting Standards Board's original mission has always been to establish the U.S. GAAP (which FASB oversees) and standards for accounting and financial reporting; however, the mission has been enhanced to include the convergence and harmonization of U.S. standards with international ones (IFRS). Attitudes on Convergence  There is some opposition to the convergence from all stakeholders involved, including accounting professionals and corporations' top management. There are various reasons for such resistance to change, and some are pertinent to the accounting profession, some to corporate management and some are shared by both. Certified Public Accountant (CPA)  Some reasons for the U.S. not embracing the standards convergence are: U.S. firms are already familiar with the existing standards; the inability or low ability to culturally relate to other countries' accounting systems; and a lack of good understanding of the international principles.\n Culture in this context is defined as \"the collective programming of the mind which distinguishes the members of one human group from another.\" Each nation and culture shares its own societal norms consisting of common characteristics, such as a value system\u2014a broad tendency to prefer certain states of affairs over others\u2014which is adopted by the majority of constituents.\n The accounting value dimensions used to define a country's accounting system, based on the country's culture, consist of the following:\nProfessionalism versus statutory controlUniformity versus conformityConservatism versus optimismSecrecy versus transparency The first two relate to authority and enforcement of accounting practice at a country level, while the last two relate to the measurement and disclosure of accounting information at a country level. Examining those dimensions and factors that impact an accounting system, it becomes evident that cultural differences have a strong impact on the accounting standards of another nation, thus complicating the standards convergence.\n Another reason why U.S. companies are resistant to converging the GAAP with the IFRS is the prevailing opinion that the principles-based IFRS fails to offer guidance compared to the rules-based U.S. standards.\u00a0As a result, U.S. accounting professionals and corporate management perceive the IFRS to be lower quality than the GAAP.\n Chief Financial Officer (CFO)  CFOs are not embracing this change because of the costs involved. There are specifically two areas that are directly impacted: a company's financial reporting and its internal control systems. Another cost involved in the transition and change to the IFRS is the public's perception of the integrity of the new converged set of standards. The SEC reporting requirements will also have to be adjusted to reflect changes in the converged system.\n IFRS does not segregate extraordinary items in the income statement, but U.S. GAAP shows them as net income. IFRS does not allow LIFO for inventory valuation whereas the U.S. GAAP provides the option of either LIFO, average cost, or FIFO.\u00a0Under the IFRS the EPS calculation does not average the individual interim period calculations, but the U.S. GAAP does. Regarding developmental costs, IFRS capitalizes them if certain criteria are met while the U.S. GAAP considers them expenses. It has been agreed to \"(a) undertake a short-term project aimed at removing a variety of individual differences between U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards' (IFRS), which include International Accounting Standards (IAS), (b) remove other differences between IFRSs and U.S. GAAP through coordination of their future work programs, (c) continue progress on the joint projects that they are undertaking, and (d) encourage their respective interpretative bodies to coordinate their activities\"Fast FactThe new set of standards that will be adopted will need to provide transparency and full disclosure similar to the U.S. standards, and it should also ensure broad acceptance. Impact of Convergence  The convergence and subsequent change of accounting and reporting standards at the international level impact a number of constituents. The International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) seeks a workable solution to alleviate the existing complexity, conflict, and confusion created by inconsistency and the lack of streamlined accounting standards in financial reporting.Corporate Management: Corporate management will benefit from simpler, streamlined standards, rules, and practices that apply to all countries and are followed worldwide. The change will afford corporate management the opportunity to raise capital via lower interest rates while lowering risk and the cost of doing business.Investors: Investors will have to re-educate themselves in reading and understanding accounting reports and financial statements following the new internationally accepted standards. At the same time, the process will provide more credible information and will be simplified without the need for conversion to the standards of the country. Further, the new standards will increase the international flow of capital.Stock Markets: Stock markets will see a reduction in the costs that accompany entering foreign exchanges, and all markets adhering to the same rules and standards will further allow markets to compete internationally for global investment opportunities.Accounting Professionals: The shift and convergence of the current standards to internationally accepted ones will force accounting professionals to learn the new standard and will lead to consistency in accounting practices.Accounting Standards Setters: The development of standards involves a number of boards and entities that make the process longer, more time-consuming, and frustrating for all parties involved. Once standards have converged, the actual process of developing and implementing new international standards will be simpler and will eliminate the reliance on agencies to develop and ratify a decision on any specific standard. Advantages and Disadvantages of Convergence  Advantages  Arguments for the convergence are:\nRenewed clarityPossible simplificationTransparencyComparability between different countries on accounting and financial reporting This will result in an increase in capital flow and international investments, which will further reduce interest rates and lead to economic growth for a specific nation and the firms with which the country conducts business.\n Timeliness and the availability of uniform information to all concerned stakeholders will also conceptually make for a smoother and more efficient process. Additionally, new safeguards will be in place to prevent another national or international economic and financial meltdown.\n Disadvantages  Arguments against accounting standards convergence are the unwillingness of the different nations involved in the process to collaborate. This is based on different cultures, ethics, standards, beliefs, types of economies, political systems, and preconceived notions for specific countries, systems, and religions.\n Another key drawback of convergence, though, lies in time. This means that it could take a great deal of time to implement a new system of accounting rules and standards across the board.\nProsCan lead to clarity, simplification, transparency, and comparabilityIncreased capital flow in international marketsPotential for free flow of information and on a timely basisConsSome countries may not want to collaborateCould take a long time to implement a new combined systemWhat Does Convergence of GAAP and IFRS Entail?Converging GAAP and IFRS involves the establishment of a single set of accounting and reporting standards. This new set of principles would be used across the board from country to country. Combining the two would require a great deal of cooperation between international accounting bodies, as well as a lot of time in order to ensure a smooth transition.Why Is There Opposition to Converging GAAP and IFRS?Converging GAAP and IFRS may make it easier to conduct business and investments on an international level. But, there is a great deal of opposition from certain stakeholders. For instance, corporate leaders would have to learn a brand new set of rules. There is also a chance that there would be general unwillingness when it comes to relating to international standards. Adopting a new, uniform set of standards also comes at a cost\u2014notably making changes to existing records in order to meet the new requirements.What Is the Purpose of Reporting Standards?Reporting standards are put in place to provide companies with a set of uniform principles so they can all inform the public (investors, analysts, and financial institutions) about their financial health and well-being. This includes the completion of financial statements in a fair, accurate, and transparent manner on a timely basis. With reporting standards in place, investors, lenders, and others can make informed decisions about different companies. The Bottom Line  It's anyone's guess how this convergence will evolve and impact the corporate financial accounting in the U.S. From a legal perspective, companies will be required to disclose qualitative and quantitative information about contracts with customers, including a maturity analysis for contracts extending beyond a year, as well as the inclusion of any significant judgments and changes in judgments made in applying the proposed standard to those contracts.\n Maybe the answer lies in the need to consider a more in-depth study and an examination of the factors influencing the molding or development of a country's accounting system. But company boards, in an effort to best serve their investors' needs, should contribute to the convergence process by replacing old standards with the new jointly developed ones.\n", "tags": ["www.investopedia.com", "articles", "wwwinvestopediacom"]}

{"url": "https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/catastrophebond.asp", "title": "Catastrophe Bond (CAT) Meaning, Benefits, Risk, Example", "text": " Catastrophe bonds (CAT bonds) are typically used by insurance companies to share the risk of major disasters with investors wanting the gains should they not happen. The events covered could include earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, and other extreme events.\n These high-yield debt instruments are designed to raise money for insurers, helping them pay claims if there's a natural disaster or catastrophe. As climate change increases the frequency and severity of natural disasters, CAT bonds have become more important in managing catastrophic risk and ensuring the stability of insurance markets.\nKey TakeawaysCatastrophe bonds (CAT bonds) are a relatively new type of financial instrument that transfers specific insurance risks related to catastrophic events like natural disasters to investors.Investors receive high yields but lose their principal if a predefined natural disaster occurs before the bond matures.CAT bonds can use various trigger mechanisms (indemnity, parametric, modeled loss, or industry loss) in how payouts are determined.Climate change and the increased frequency of natural disasters are making CAT bonds more important in the insurance industry, though the uptick in the number and severity of these catastrophes increases the risk for investors.The first CAT Bond exchange-traded fund (ETF) was announced in the first quarter of 2025. What Are Catastrophe Bonds?  Catastrophe bonds emerged in the mid-1990s following Hurricane Andrew and the Northridge earthquake, which caused unprecedented insurance losses and highlighted the need for alternative risk transfer mechanisms. These extreme events demonstrated that traditional reinsurance alone might not be sufficient to handle large-scale catastrophes.\n The concept behind CAT bonds is relatively straightforward: They create a market-based system for sharing catastrophic risk (i.e., a risk impacting a large number of policyholders simultaneously and severely). Traditional property insurance works by pooling risks across many policyholders, but some events are so large that they can overwhelm this system. CAT bonds solve this problem by tapping into the vast resources of the capital markets, allowing insurance companies to spread risk beyond the traditional players.\n Think of it as a sort of \"reverse insurance\"\u2014instead of paying premiums to receive protection, investors receive premiums for providing protection. The catch is that investors risk losing their investment if a specified catastrophic event occurs before the bond matures. This arrangement creates a new asset class that appeals to sophisticated investors seeking higher yields and portfolio diversification.\n$146 BillionTotal global insured natural catastrophe losses for 2024 were $146 billion. How Catastrophe Bonds Work  CAT bonds work through a special purpose vehicle (SPV) that acts as an intermediary between the sponsor (usually an insurance or reinsurance company) and investors. The sponsor pays premiums to the SPV, while investors put their principal into the SPV, which typically invests in safe, short-term securities (like U.S. Treasurys).\n If a triggering catastrophe doesn't occur during the bond's term (usually one to three years), investors receive their principal back plus interest payments that typically offer higher yields than traditional bonds. However, if a qualifying catastrophe does happen, the sponsor can withdraw funds from the SPV to pay insurance claims, and investors may lose some or all of their principal. The triggering events in a particular catastrophe bond will be precisely defined in the bond's documentation (such as its prospectus) and can be structured in several ways:\nIndemnity triggers: Based on the sponsor's actual losses (e.g., if an issuing insurer's claims exceed $1 billion)Industry loss triggers: Based on industrywide losses from an event (e.g., if total insurance industry losses exceed $10 billion)Parametric triggers: Based on a single, objective measurement, like earthquake magnitude or hurricane wind speedModeled loss triggers: Based on computer-modeled loss projections from multiple parameters from the actual event Benefits and Risks of CAT Bonds  Benefits  For insurance companies, CAT bonds provide an alternative source of reinsurance coverage (insurance for insurance companies) that's fully collateralized (i.e., backed up by readily available funds) and typically multiyear, offering more stability than traditional annual reinsurance contracts. They also help insurers transfer specific risks that might be difficult to reinsure through conventional means.\n For investors, CAT bonds offer attractive yields and portfolio diversification benefits since their returns typically have a low correlation with traditional financial markets. For example, during the 2008 financial crisis, CAT bonds performed relatively well compared with other fixed-income investments. Risks  The primary risk for investors is the potential loss of principal if a triggering event occurs. Here are the other risks:\nBasis risk: For insurance companies using non-indemnity triggers (like wind speed of hurricanes, so the payout might not match actual losses)Model risk: The possibility that catastrophe models underestimate event probability or severityClimate change risk: The increasing frequency and severity of natural disastersComplexity risk: These instruments can be difficult to valueLiquidity risk: The secondary market for CAT bonds can be relatively illiquidCAT Bonds Pros & ConsProsOffer higher yields to investorsPortfolio diversification for investorsAdditional source of reinsurance for insurersConsInvestors may lose entire principal upon triggering eventInsurers may not receive payouts equal to actual lossesClimate change risksTipCatastrophe futures, launched by the Chicago Board of Trade in 1992, were an earlier attempt to create standardized insurance derivatives based on catastrophe loss indexes. They currently trade on the\u00a0New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX). Example of a Catastrophe Bond  Let's make up a hypothetical CAT bond to be issued by the Florida Hurricane Insurance Co. (FHIC) with these characteristics:\nPrincipal: $200 millionTerm: Three yearsInterest: SOFR +5%Trigger: Wind speeds exceeding 145 mph in specific counties (parametric) FHIC pays premiums into the SPV, and investors purchase the bonds, while the $200 million notional value is invested in U.S. Treasurys and money market funds.\n If no qualifying hurricane occurs during the three-year term, investors receive their principal back plus interest payments at the attractive rate of SOFR (a commonly used overnight rate) plus 5%.\n However, suppose a hurricane with winds exceeding 145 mph hits the specified counties. In that case, FHIC can access the collateral to pay out claims to its affected policyholders, and investors could lose some or all their principal.\n CAT Bond ETFs  In April 2025,\u00a0Brookmont Capital Management LLC launched the first CAT bond ETF on the New York Stock Exchange. The ETF, managed by King Ridge Capital Advisors Inc., will hold a portfolio of up to 75 catastrophe bonds from the estimated 250 in circulation, Bloomberg reported. The fund's creation comes after two years of exceptional performance of CAT bonds for investors. The Swiss Re Global Cat Bond Index posted gains of 17% in 2024, following record 20% returns in 2023. These are far higher than traditional high-yield fixed-income investments, with U.S. high-yield corporate bonds returning about 8% and 13% in the same periods, respectively. The new ETF could bring more investors indirectly into a market, feeding an industry that's growing for three reasons:\nThe increasing frequency of extreme weather events linked to climate changeMore disasters are striking urbanized areasInsurance companies are retreating from high-risk regions, which has created a need The Bottom Line  Catastrophe bonds (CAT bonds) provide insurers with an alternative to traditional reinsurance. In return, investors get a high-yield bond that could offer diversification.\n While these instruments do carry significant risks, their importance continues to grow as climate change increases both the frequency and severity of natural disasters. As the market matures and modeling capabilities improve, CAT bonds are likely to become an even more important tool in the global risk management tool kit.\n", "tags": ["www.investopedia.com", "terms", "wwwinvestopediacom"]}

Want to know how Wall Street's top minds spot tomorrow's biggest winners? Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (GS) has a surprisingly simple method: find companies that can consistently grow their sales by at least 10%. They call it the \"Rule of 10,\" and in 2025, 21 companies in the S&P 500 make the cut, including some of the fast-growing companies that we discuss below.\nKey TakeawaysGoldman Sachs created the \"Rule of 10\" to identify the next wave of stocks poised to soar in value.To pass the test, companies must consistently generate sales growth of 10% and be capable of continuing to do so in the future.In early 2025, 21 S&P 500 stocks meet Goldman\u2019s revenue criteria.Investment decisions shouldn\u2019t just be based on the results of one stock screen. What Is the Rule of 10?  Goldman Sachs figured a good way to identify the stocks with the most potential to outperform the S&P 500 was to analyze what made today\u2019s biggest winners\u2014the so-called \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d made up of Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL), Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN), Apple Inc. (AAPL), Meta Platforms, Inc. (META), Microsoft Corporation (MSFT), NVIDIA Corp. (NVDA), and Tesla, Inc. (TSLA)\u2014so successful and popular. Armed with that information, the bank's analysts could then build a screen that reveals the future growth engines of the stock market. The name of this screen is the \u201cRule of 10.\u201d\n How the Rule of 10 Works  To pass the test, companies must meet the following conditions:\nBe in the S&P 500 Index.Have grown revenues by at least 10% in each of the past two years.Be expected to grow sales by at least 10% in the present year, the next fiscal year, and the fiscal year after that. Stocks that Meet the Rule of 10 Criteria  We screened the S&P 500 for companies with at least 10% revenue growth in 2022 and 2023 (the previous years) and forecasted sales growth of at least 10% in 2024, 2025, 2026, and 2027. The following stocks, as of Jan. 28, 2025, passed the test.\n How Can Investors Find the Rule of 10 Stocks?  The stocks that pass the \u201cRule of 10\u201d test are subject to change as years pass and revenue growth projections are adjusted by analysts. If you want to see which stocks Goldman thinks have a decent chance of outperforming the market in the future, you\u2019ll need to input the criteria mentioned above into a screening tool.\n It\u2019s also possible to gather the relevant data for each stock in the S&P 500, but that would take much longer.\nFast FactAlphabet, Amazon, Synopsys Inc. (SNPS), Visa Inc. (V), and Intuitive Surgical (ISRG) were among the popular firms with investors that narrowly missed out. The Bottom Line  Goldman Sachs's \u201cRule of 10\u201d aims to identify the next wave of S&P 500 stocks capable of delivering the most capital appreciation by focusing on past and future revenues. It's a stock screen, which means it's designed to be a starting point for generating ideas\u2014not a final list for entering investment orders today.\n", "tags": ["www.investopedia.com", "10x-rule-for-finding-stock-market-winners-8782170", "wwwinvestopediacom"]}

The Suriname guilder was the official currency of the South American nation of Suriname until 2004, when it was replaced by the Suriname dollar (SRD). Through this transfer, each newly issued Surinamese dollar replaced 1,000 SRGs.Key TakeawaysThe Suriname Guilder (SRG) was the national currency of Suriname.It was replaced by the Suriname Dollar (SRD) in 2004.The economy of Suriname is relatively underdeveloped and is heavily reliant on raw commodity exports.Inflation has recently gripped the country, reaching 34.9% in 2020. Understanding the SRG  Note that the cent coins representing fractions of one guilder remain in use, with denominations of 1, 5, 10, 25, 1 SRD, and 2.50 SRD. Rather than referring to fractions of an SRG, however, these coins now represent the same fraction of one SRD. Surinamese guilders were named after the Dutch guilder, which was the currency of the Netherlands for almost 500 years prior to being replaced by the euro (EUR) in 2002. A former Dutch colony, Suriname is located on the northern coast of South America. It is bordered by Brazil in the south, with Guyana in the west and French Guiana in the east. The Surinamese dollar was first introduced in January 2004 as Suriname's official currency, replacing the guilder at a rate of 1,000:1. Old coins based on the former currency stayed in circulation with the new dollar bills, largely for the sake of convenience and cost savings.\n As an economically developing nation, Suriname's economy relies heavily on natural resources such as gold, bauxite, and oil, and it can be sensitive to changes in world commodity prices. The guilder itself experienced high inflation in the early 1990s, which was part of the rationale for the country's decision to replace it with the Surinamese dollar. Unfortunately, the SRD has recently also been gripped with severe inflation. Real-World Example of the SRG  Ultimately, the strength of a national currency is based on the economic strength of its issuing nation. In the case of the SRG and its new replacement, the SRD, the economy of Suriname is relatively small and underdeveloped.\n The country is heavily reliant on raw commodity production, with gold accounting for over 78% of total exports in 2019, with unprocessed wood and oil also being important (although making up far less of the total exports compared to gold, 5% and 3.8%, respectively). Suriname has recently experienced a bout of extreme inflation, with annual inflation reaching over 34.9% in 2020. Unemployment, meanwhile, was 8.7% in 2020, with gross domestic product (GDP) currently at -14.5% per annum.", "tags": ["www.investopedia.com", "terms", "wwwinvestopediacom"]}
{"url": "https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/accruals.asp", "title": "What Are Accruals? How Accrual Accounting Works, With Examples", "text": " Accruals reflect money earned or owed that hasn't changed hands yet. When you buy something on credit or get paid for work a month after you do it, those are accruals in action. Other examples include tax and energy bills, wages, and products sold in installments.\n Almost every business deals with this timing mismatch between when things happen and when money changes hands. That's where accrual accounting comes in\u2014it's a way to record these transactions when they happen rather than when the money moves. It's the preferred method of the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) because it gives a clearer picture of how a business is doing. Without it, it would be like trying to judge your finances only by looking at what's in your checking account right now, without considering your bills or the money others owe you.\nKey TakeawaysAn accrual reflects money earned or spent but not yet paid for.Without accruals, companies would only show income and expenses related to cash flows or money coming in and out of their bank accounts.With accrual accounting, accountants must enter, adjust, and track revenues and expenses from the moment they are earned or incurred to the moment they are finally paid.There are four types of accruals: accrued expenses, prepaid expenses, accrued revenue, and deferred revenue. What Are Accruals?  Businesses are rarely cash-only these days. They often sell products or services now and get paid later. In accrual accounting, these uncollected revenues need to be accounted for. The same applies to expenses. If a company incurs an expense, it needs to be recorded even if it hasn\u2019t been paid yet. An example of an accrued expense is a tax bill. The tax relates to the prior year\u2019s earnings and isn\u2019t payable immediately. Accrued revenue, meanwhile, could be a product or service that\u2019s sold on credit.\n Without accruals, companies would only show income and expenses related to cash flows or money coming in and out of their bank accounts. With that method, if a company got paid the following year for work it did the prior year, its financial statements wouldn't reflect the actual level of economic activity within each specific reporting period. The same could occur with expenses not being allocated to the correct period they were incurred. Accrual Accounting Vs. Cash Accounting  The main alternative to accrual accounting is the cash basis of accounting. Cash accounting is pretty straightforward\u2014you only record money when it enters or leaves your bank account. The accrual method requires that companies record revenue when cash is received and expenses after they are paid. That makes cash accounting more common among smaller companies.\n Accrual accounting is usually required for larger companies. This method requires more accounting but provides a more accurate picture of a business's activity and finances.\n Suppose a company collects payment from a customer for a service but hasn\u2019t yet paid its expenses for the job, and it's the end of the tax year. This happens all the time, and cash accounting can make the company look more profitable than it actually is.\n Recording Accruals  With accrual accounting, accountants must enter, adjust, and track revenues and expenses from when they are earned or incurred to when they are paid.\nDouble-entry accounting is employed, meaning each transaction must have a debit and a credit entry. In terms of revenues that have been earned but not yet paid, a journal entry would be made, debiting the \"accounts receivable\" listed on the balance sheet and crediting the \"revenue\" account on the income statement. This move increases revenue and accounts receivable in the company\u2019s financial statement.\n For expenses incurred but not yet paid, the accountant would debit the \"expenses\" account on the income statement and credit the \"accounts payable\" account on the balance sheet. This increases a company's expenses and accounts payable, where a firm's short-term obligations are logged. Types of Accruals  These are the four main types:\n Accrued Expenses  Also known as accrued liabilities, these are expenses incurred but not paid for during an accounting period, such as utility bills. Electricity is generally not paid upfront. It\u2019s possible the electricity consumed in October won\u2019t be paid until December. This needs to be recorded as an accrued expense.\n Prepaid Expenses  Some expenses are paid upfront before they are fully consumed. These are called prepaid expenses and are logged as an asset. An example of a prepaid expense is a retainer for a lawyer or consultant.\n Accrued Revenue  Accrued revenues\u00a0occur when a company delivers a good or service but hasn\u2019t yet been paid. For example, a company might sell goods on credit.\n In this case, the customer receives the order immediately but pays the entire balance over time. Under accrual accounting, the outstanding money should be recorded in an accrued revenue receivable account representing an asset.\n Deferred Revenue  Companies can also demand payment before delivering a good or service to a customer. For example, online retailers require payment before shipping; subscriptions are often paid in advance.\n In these cases, the company sets up a deferred revenue account (a liability) to show it has received the cash but still needs to deliver the good or service.\n Examples of Accruals  It\u2019s common for companies and customers to prepay or pay later for goods and services. Here are some examples.\n Utilities  Utilities are commonly provided before being paid for. For instance, a company uses electricity to power its operations and pays for this consumption later when the meters have been read and the bill arrives.\n Under accrual accounting, the company consuming the electricity would make a journal entry to record the cost of this yet-to-be-paid-for service as an accrued expense, debiting the \"expense\" account and crediting the \"accounts payable\" account.\n Conversely, the utility company supplying the electricity would report the revenue it earned when it started earning it by debiting the \"accounts receivable\" account on the balance sheet and crediting the \"revenue\" account on the income statement.\n Taxes, Interest, Wages, and Bonuses  Taxes, interest, wages, and bonuses also tend to be paid later. A company could pay interest on a bond it issued semiannually, pay taxes on money earned months ago, and pay wages and bonuses after work has been done. In accrual accounting, these accrued expenses need to be accounted for in the period they were incurred.\n The Bottom Line  It\u2019s common to prepay or pay later for goods and services. Accruals represent money earned or spent but not yet paid for.\n In accrual accounting, these transactions must be recorded on the income statement and balance sheet before money changes hands. If companies only document income and expenses after they are paid, their financial statements could be misleading and might not adequately reflect the period referenced. That\u2019s why GAAP and IFRS prefer accrual accounting.\n", "tags": ["www.investopedia.com", "terms", "wwwinvestopediacom"]}

Data from the latest Consumer Price Index (CPI) report also helped underpin the rally, as indications of a cooldown in \"core\" inflation in December reinvigorated optimism that the Federal Reserve might implement additional interest-rate cuts in 2025.\n The S&P 500 surged 1.8% on Wednesday. Outperformance among several financial sector components helped drive the Dow 1.7% higher, while the recalibrated rate-cut outlook buoyed the tech-heavy Nasdaq, which jumped 2.5%.\n Tesla (TSLA) shares drove 8% higher, logging the strongest performance in the S&P 500, following reports of a strong first day of orders in China for the carmaker's updated Model Y electric vehicle (EV). The refreshed sport utility vehicle (SUV) is expected to become available in U.S. and European markets within several months. In addition, Morgan Stanley analysts predicted that Tesla stock could reach as high as $800 per share in the coming year.\n Bank of New York Mellon (BK) was among the financial firms that posted positive results, with gains in fee revenue and declines in non-interest expenses helping the bank top quarterly profit estimates. Although BNY's CEO highlighted uncertainties related to the incoming presidential administration's tariff proposals and the unclear prognosis for interest rates, he stressed the bank's positive momentum heading into 2025. Bank of New York Mellon shares also gained 8%, leading bank stocks to rise higher on Wednesday.\n While bank earnings dominated the financial headlines, another strong performance came from shares of Intuitive Surgical (ISRG), which added 7.7% after the medical technology firm released preliminary fourth-quarter results. Year-over-year sales growth of 25% exceeded consensus forecasts, and procedures performed using the company's da Vinci surgical platform jumped 18% from a year ago. Increases in procedures help Intuitive drive higher sales of its single-use instruments and accessories, but the company expects growth in worldwide procedures to decelerate slightly in 2025. Lululemon Athletica (LULU) shares fell 3.1%, losing the most of any S&P 500 constituent on Wednesday. The stock initially moved higher on Monday after the maker of yoga attire and other apparel lifted its quarterly sales and profit guidance, highlighting a strong performance during the holiday season. Since then, however, Lululemon shares have experienced volatility and have been unable to hold onto those gains.\n Shares of generic drug manufacturer Viatris (VTRS) sank 2.8% on Wednesday. Last month, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) restricted the import of 11 generic drugs produced at a Viatris plant in India, citing infractions related to manufacturing, handling, and quality control at the facility. Wednesday's drop marked a continuation of a downtrend for the stock since the FDA announced the restrictions.\n Hershey (HSY) shares slipped 2.3% on the day. Immediately after the markets closed last week, the chocolate maker announced that CEO Michelle Buck plans to depart from the company. The uncertainty surrounding the leadership team came shortly after a key Hershey shareholder rejected a buyout bid from snack food giant Mondelez (MDLZ) that would have created the world's largest confectionary company.\nCORRECTION: This article has been updated with the correct closing level for Bank of New York Mellon shares.

Intuitive Surgical (ISRG) shares hit another record high Thursday, one day after the medical technology company issued preliminary fourth-quarter and full-year revenue above expectations amid growing demand for its surgical robotics equipment. The company placed 493 of its da Vinci surgical systems in the fourth quarter of last year, up from 415 in 2023. It also said that procedures using the equipment in the period grew 17% from the prior year, driven by use during cancer operations. The technology, which the company says has completed over 14 million procedures, assists surgeons' hand movements, helping to perform minimally invasive surgery. Intuitive Surgical shares gained 0.7% to close at just above $584 on Thursday, after surging nearly 8% yesterday. Intuitive Surgical shares have risen 60% over the past 12 months, handily outpacing the S&P 500's return of 25% during the period.\n Below, we take a closer look at the technicals on Intuitive Surgical's chart and point out key price levels worth watching out for.\n Extended Rising Wedge  Intuitive Surgical shares have traded in an extended rising wedge since early February last year, keeping the price confined within the pattern\u2019s two converging upward sloping trendlines.\n More recently, the price consolidated near the formation\u2019s lower trendline and 50-day moving average before gapping higher this week.

In this case, we add $70 to $580, which project a target at $650.\n Major Support Levels of Interest  During pullbacks, investors should initially keep a close eye on the $550 level. The shares could attract buying interest in this area near the low of Wednesday\u2019s gap, which also aligns with a period of consolidation in November just below the stock\u2019s all-time high (ATH).\u00a0\n Finally, a close below this region opens the door for a retest of lower support around $520. A retracement to this location could see investors look for entry points near a trendline that links the October peak and December trough.\nThe comments, opinions, and analyses expressed on Investopedia are for informational purposes only.

{"url": "https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/income-sensitive-repayment.asp", "title": "Income-Sensitive Repayment (ISR)", "text": " What Is Income-Sensitive Repayment?  Income-sensitive repayment (ISR) is a repayment method for loans serviced by lenders participating in the Federal Family Education Loan Program (FFELP). The ISR is intended to make it easier for borrowers with lower-paying jobs to afford their monthly loan payments. The ISR is an alternative to income-contingent repayment.\n The monthly loan payment amount is based on a fixed percentage of the borrower's gross monthly income, between 4% and 25%. The monthly payment must be greater than or equal to the interest that the loan accrues.\n FFEL program loans include three types of loans: FFEL Plus and Subsidized and Unsubsidized Federal Stafford Loans, however, the program was discontinued in July 2010. If you had the loan in 2010 or earlier, you can still qualify for income-sensitive repayment.\nKey TakeawaysIncome-sensitive repayment (ISR) is a repayment method for loans offered by lenders who participated in the now-defunct Federal Family Education Loan Program (FFELP). Only loan holders who received their loans before or in July 2010 are eligible, so as of 2021, some of these loan holders are phasing out. The ISR is intended to help individuals with lower-paying jobs afford to pay their loans, and the payment is based on a fixed percentage (4% and 25%) of the borrower's gross monthly income. The monthly loan payment must be greater than or equal to the interest that the loan accrues to be in the program.  How Income-Sensitive Repayment Works  Income-sensitive repayment allows lower-earning borrowers to reduce their monthly payment amount, depending on the gross monthly income.\ufeff\ufeff This method of repayment increases the total amount of interest that will be paid on loan. Borrowers must apply each year to be eligible for ISR and provide a copy of their tax returns and W-2s.\n Special Considerations  Not all student loans are eligible for income-sensitive repayment. Only loans under FFELP are available for this exceptional assistance. If you take it, this option is only available for five years, and you are still responsible for paying back your loans. However, you might be able to speak to your loan service provider (a lender participating in FFELP) and see if you can move to another type of program.\nImportantThe Federal Family Education Loan Program (FFELP) no longer exists as of July 2010, but it is possible to find other student loan income-based repayment plans. Here's the catch: remember FFELP ended in July 2010, and if your loans were issued after that date, you don't qualify for this program. However, if your loans were issued in 2010 or before that date, you might be eligible. As of 2021, many years have gone by since this program was active in the student loan world.\n There are other payment plans based on income and given that FFELP is no longer an option for students who went to school past 2010, they are most certainly worth looking into if you need a new payment plan. The four income-drive payment plans are as follows:\nIncome-contingent repaymentIncome-based repaymentPay as you earn repaymentRevised pay as you earn repayment.  However, in order to qualify to apply for one of these programs, you must take out a direct consolidation loan and consolidate your FFEL loans into it.\n", "tags": ["www.investopedia.com", "terms", "wwwinvestopediacom"]}

U.S. stock futures are falling as investor disappointment with tech giants Tesla and Alphabet weighs on investors after all three major indexes closed lower yesterday. Here's what investors need to know today.\n 1. Tesla Sinks After EV Maker Posts Profit Slump, Robotaxi Delay  Tesla (TSLA) shares are plunging 8% in premarket trading after the electric vehicle maker posted a 45% drop in second-quarter profit as demand for EV cools and the average selling price of its vehicles decline. Also weighing on the results of Magnificent Seven tech giant was its warning of a rise in artificial intelligence (AI) costs and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Elon Musk\u2019s confirmation that the planned date for its highly anticipated robotaxi event had been delayed to October 10 from August 8.\u00a0 2. Google Parent Alphabet Posts Earnings Beat But Ad Sales Disappoint  Alphabet (GOOGL) shares are falling 3% in premarket trading after the Google parent posted slowing advertising growth even as it reported second-quarter results that beat analysts' expectations on the back of strength in its cloud services and core search business. Ad sales, a\u00a0key revenue driver at Google, rose 11.1% from last year, but that was down from the 13% year-over-year jump it registered in the first quarter. Alphabet Chief Financial Officer (CFO) Ruth Porat also told investors that depreciation and higher expenses from AI investments could affect operating margins in the third quarter.\n 3. LVMH Sales Slip Shows Impact of China Weakness, Frugal Consumer  LVMH\u2019s (LVMUY) second-quarter results, with tepid sales disappointing investors, showed that the pullback by consumers on high-end items and cooling Chinese spending is affecting even the world\u2019s largest luxury firm. The company, whose brands include Dior and Louis Vuitton, reported Q2 year-over-year organic revenue growth of just 1% to 20.98 billion euros. Sales in Asia excluding Japan plunged 14%, although Chinese spending growth in Japan and Europe was \"strong.\" LVMH shares fell 4% in French trading, while trench coat maker Burberry (BURBY), Gucci owner Kering (PPRUY), and Cartier owner Richemont (CFRUY) were all lower in European trading.\u00a0 4. Chipotle to Report After the Bell in First Results Since Stock Split  Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) is expected to show second-quarter profit and sales gains when the burrito chain reports earnings after the bell. The results are its first since its 50-for-1 stock split last month. Analysts expect Chipotle's revenue to rise 17% year-over-year, with profits projected to jump about 28%, according to estimates compiled by Visible Alpha. While the results are expected to show the company\u2019s resilience as its rivals suffer from the inflation-fueled downturn in consumer spending, Baird analysts noted that some indicators show demand \"softening\" earlier this month. Chipotle shares are little changed in premarket trading.\n 5. Thermo Fisher Beat Estimates, Lifts Guidance  Shares of Thermo Fisher Scientific (TMO) are edging lower in premarket trading even after the medical device maker posted higher-than-forecast results and upped both its full-year revenue and earnings outlook.

Tesla is expected to produce second-quarter revenue near what it posted for the same period last year.\u00a0\n Also on Tuesday, Google parent Alphabet looks to better its performance from the previous quarter, when it reported a 15% revenue jump, while also unveiling its first dividend for shareholders. On Wednesday, investors will hear from IBM and ServiceNow.\u00a0\n Top telecom carriers are reporting this week, with Verizon Communications\u2019 financial update on Monday. AT&T\u2019s earnings update on\u00a0 Wednesday comes as the company contends with a data breach. Cable and internet provider Comcast reports on Tuesday.\n Earnings from pharmaceutical maker AbbVie come after the company warned that sales of its popular arthritis drug Humira faces increasing competition.

Other firms with consumer brands reporting this week include Colgate-Palmolive, 3M, and Unilever.\u00a0\n Inflation, GDP Data Come Ahead of Fed Meeting  As anticipation for interest-rate reductions mounts, market watchers will get key inflation data on Friday, when the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) index will show whether price growth continued to slow in June.\u00a0\n The data comes as Federal Reserve officials have spoken of gaining more confidence that the annual rate of price increases is approaching their target goal of 2%. Having set interest rates at decades-high levels to help combat the spikes in inflation in 2022 and 2023, Fed officials are looking for more good news on price levels before starting to ease those rates.\u00a0\n Friday\u2019s PCE report offers the last major piece of economic data before the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meets at the end of July. While most investors and economists believe that the Fed will wait until its September meeting, some are arguing that the central bank should move in July on a rate cut. Friday\u2019s inflation report could strengthen that case for officials. Meanwhile, there won\u2019t be any guidance from Federal Reserve officials this week because they are in a blackout period that prohibits public comment ahead of the following week\u2019s FOMC meeting.\n Investors will also get their first look at second-quarter GDP figures on Thursday after a strong June retail sales report has led some economists to think the data could come in stronger than anticipated.\u00a0\n Other economic data on tap this week includes June updates for both new and existing home sales, along with consumer sentiment, retail and wholesale inventories, and an update on the U.S. trade deficit via the June advance international trade report.Do you have a news tip for Investopedia reporters?

The PCE is the Federal Reserve\u2019s preferred measure of inflation, making Friday\u2019s report the latest reading on their progress toward driving inflation down to the 2% annual rate target.\u00a0\n After the inflation rate plummeted in 2023, it has mostly moved sideways in 2024, with Fed officials referring to recent inflation reports as \u201cbumps,\u201d like last month\u2019s PCE report showing inflation moving higher to 2.5% in February.\u00a0\n Friday's release of the Michigan Consumer Sentiment index could also attract attention from Fed officials, particularly consumer expectations on inflation, which can play a key role in the path of prices.\u00a0\n While the Fed isn\u2019t expected to change interest rates from their current levels of 5.25% to 5.5% at the upcoming FOMC meeting, the data could play a role in officials changing their projections for future cuts.

As you know, the biotech firms and large companies working on vaccines for COVID-19 have been the dominant focus of traders. However, chart patterns across the sector suggest that the entire segment from diagnostics to health insurance will be worth watching for the remainder of 2020 and likely for a good portion of 2021.\nKey TakeawaysMany healthcare stocks have been trading within a period of consolidation since the March lows. Recent price action suggests that the next leg of the uptrend could be getting underway.Active traders will likely use the trendlines seen in the charts of the Vanguard Health Care ETF (VHT) and its top holdings to determine where to place buy and stop orders. Vanguard Health Care ETF (VHT)  Most traders who are seeking to gain targeted exposure to specific market segments often turn to exchange-traded products such as the Vanguard Health Care ETF. As the name suggests, the fund's managers have designed the exchange-traded fund (ETF) to track the performance of stocks in the healthcare sector. The fund's holdings comprise a wide range of companies that involve or provide medical or healthcare products, services, technology, or equipment.\n Looking at the chart below, you can see that the dotted trendlines have provided clear levels of support and resistance over the past year. Followers of technical analysis often turn toward major trendlines for determining the placement of their buy and stop orders. In the case of VHT shown below, buy orders will most likely be placed as close to current levels as possible. From a risk-management perspective, stop-loss orders could be placed below one of the dotted trendlines, the 50-day moving average, or the 200-day moving average, depending on risk tolerance and outlook.\nStockCharts.com\u00a0 UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (UNH)  As one of the top holdings of the VHT ETF, UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (UNH) will likely be one of the main focuses of active traders over the weeks ahead. Looking at the chart below, you can see that the price of the stock has been trading within an ascending channel pattern since the recovery from the March lows.\n Followers of technical analysis will want to take note of the recent breakout above the upper bound of the channel, which is often used as an indication of the beginning of the next leg in the uptrend. Active traders will most likely set stop-loss orders below one of the dotted trendlines or long-term moving averages, depending on risk tolerance and outlook.\nStockCharts.com Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (TMO)  Another top holding of the VHT ETF that will likely capture the attention of active traders over the days ahead is Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (TMO). From the chart pattern shown below, you can see that the stock is trading within a clearly established uptrend with few signs of reversal.\n The proximity to the 50-day moving average and two dotted trendlines will likely be a strong enough case for bullish traders to look at buying near current levels. To protect against sudden shifts in market sentiment, stop-loss orders will most likely be placed below $459.57 or $377.97, depending on risk tolerance and outlook.\nStockCharts.comTipHealthcare stocks, as represented by the Healthcare Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLV), have performed on par with the broader market. XLV has provided investors with a total return of 18.5% over the past 12 months, just slightly above the Russell 1000's total return of 18.4%, as of Oct. 19, 2020. The Bottom Line  Companies within the healthcare sector such as those focused on the development of vaccines for COVID-19 have been the focus of most investors. However, based on the charts discussed above, other companies from across the sector in niche segments such as diagnostics and healthcare plans could be worth a closer look\nAt the time of writing, Casey Murphy did not own a position in any of the assets mentioned.Do you have a news tip for Investopedia reporters?

On the other hand, during periods of recession or heightened market volatility, it often seems like the rules change, and it can feel like an impossible task to find segments that are poised to benefit because during times when most sectors move in lockstep. One theme that often captures the attention of active traders during difficult times is the concept of increased exposure to sin stocks.\n For those new to finance, sin stocks represent the segments of the market that are often associated with an activity that is considered unethical or immoral such as the consumption of alcohol or tobacco. The primary idea is that consumers will cut spending in nearly every area of their lives other than vice and leisure. In this article, we'll take a look at a common fund used to track alcohol and tobacco companies along with two top holdings that are geared more toward testing and detection of abuse.\n AdvisorShares Vice ETF (ACT)  Traders who are interested in gaining exposure to niche market segments such as tobacco and alcohol companies often turn to exchange-traded products such as the Advisor Shares Vice ETF (ACT). As you can see from the chart below, the price has recently moved above the long-term resistance of its 200-day moving average, retraced toward the newfound support, and started to resume the move higher.\n Traders will want to note how the recent increase in buying pressure has triggered a breakout beyond the resistance of the previous swing high and how the momentum has triggered a bullish crossover between the 50-day and 200-day moving average. This long-term buy signal is one of the most popular among followers of technical analysis and often marks the beginning of a primary uptrend. From a risk-management perspective, stop-loss orders will most likely be placed below $23.02 in order to maximize the risk/reward of the trade and to protect against a sudden shift in market sentiment.\nStockCharts.com Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (TMO)  With a weighting of 8.19%, Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (TMO) sits as the second position within the ACT portfolio. As you can see from the weekly chart below, the stock has been trading within a defined channel pattern since mid-2018, with the brief exception of the breakdown this past March.\n This chart clearly shows that the bulls are in control of the long-term trend, and the recent break above the upper trendline even suggests that the upward momentum could accelerate over the weeks and months ahead. Depending on risk tolerance and outlook, the dotted trendlines suggest that stop-losses will most likely be placed below $400 or $350 to protect against a shift in underlying fundamentals.\nStockCharts.com Abbot Laboratories (ABT)  Another top holding of the ACT ETF, with a weighting of 6.51%, that could be worth a closer look over the days ahead is Abbot Laboratories (ABT). Taking a look at the chart below, you'll notice that the price has recently been trading within a period of consolidation since breaking beyond the 200-day moving average back in April.\n The bullish crossover between the 50-day and 200-day moving average shown by the blue circle was a clear sign that the bulls took over control of the long-term momentum. The recent bounce from the 200-day moving average and close above the nearby resistance levels confirm that the bulls are in control, and now that all recent levels of resistance have been cleared, it is likely that traders will expect a move higher over the days and weeks ahead.\nStockCharts.com The Bottom Line  The continued spending on vices such as alcohol and tobacco has captured the attention of active traders. Based on the patterns discussed above, it looks as though this segment, along with key companies associated with toxicology, could be worth watching.\nAt the time of writing, Casey Murphy did not own a position in any of the assets mentioned.Do you have a news tip for Investopedia reporters?

Those stocks are seen rallying alongside the health care boom and include life-sciences tools and equipment firms such as Illumina (ILMN), the leader in gene-sequencing technology; Thermo Fisher Scientific (TMO), which sells an array of lab tools and equipment; Agilent Technologies (A) and Danaher (DHR), which also sell lab equipment, diagnostic tools, and products outside life sciences; and Bio-Techne (TECH), which makes protein-science kits and new \u201cliquid biopsy\u201d tests, according to a detailed story in Barron\u2019s.\n5 Innovation-Led Stocks \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Illumina; gene-sequencing technology\n \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thermo Fisher Scientific; lab tools and equipment\n \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Agilent Technologies; lab equipment, diagnostic tools\n \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Danaher; lab equipment, diagnostic tools\n \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Bio-Techne; protein-science kits and liquid biopsy tests\n \u2018Healthiest Funding Cycle in Years\u2019  As gene analysis and other technologies open up new markets in healthcare, life sciences companies are ideally positioned because they make lab tools, scientific-research equipment and daily supplies. They also have benefited from a surge in funding from both the private sector and government. Life sciences is \u201cone of the few areas where we see bipartisan support in Congress,\u201d notes Charles Kummeth, CEO of BioTechne.\n The National Institutes of Health upped its budget by 5% over last year to $39 billion for 2019. Meanwhile, China is forecast to increase spending on life sciences by 10% per year, on track to exceed the U.S. in spending as a percentage of GDP by the early 2020s. As for the private sector, drug companies are boosting spending on R&D, up 3% per year and estimated to reach $177 billion in 2019, according to Bank of America.\n Here's a closer look at two of these stocks.\n Genomics Play  Illumina is set to gain from its leadership position in the market for whole genome-sequencing, in which it maintains a more than 75% share. According to Morningstar, over 90% of sequenced genetic material comes from an Illumina machine. Genomics plays a central role in the quest to detect genetic mutations and assess the effectiveness of treatments associated with disease. The company\u2019s widely installed base for whole-genome sequencing is the standard platform for globally funded population studies, in which over six million projects have been announced and only 500,000 have been run, per Leerink Research. Illumina's bulls remain optimistic even though the shares trade at 48 times estimated earnings.\n Niche Supplier  Thermo Fisher has managed to post revenue growth by 11% annually over the past five years, reaching $24.1 billion in 2018 through organic growth and acquisitions. The company, which sells a diverse array of products from scientific instruments to consumable materials, says its supplies fulfill \u201ca very specific set of requirements within the industry.\u201d CEO Marc Casper tells analysts that while China is a manufacturing hub and major end market for Thermo, the company isn\u2019t feeling the effect of tariffs, given a large portion of its products sold in China remain exempt.\n Thermo's stock also looks attractive from a valuation standpoint, trading at 20 times earnings, below the industry average.\n Looking Ahead  It\u2019s important to note that emerging technologies and research can\u00a0abruptly change the direction of tech-driven companies, meaning that not all of these stocks are a sure bet to prosper longterm. Also, high expectations for the stocks are reflected in rich valuations averaging 25 times 2019 earnings. Any slight earnings miss could send their stocks plummeting.\nDo you have a news tip for Investopedia reporters?

{"url": "https://www.investopedia.com/articles/company-insights/090216/when-will-amazon-accept-bitcoin-amzn.asp", "title": "When Will Amazon (AMZN) Accept Bitcoin?", "text": " Despite Bitcoin's status as the world's most famous digital currency, Amazon has yet to accept it as a payment method, even though companies such as PayPal, Overstock, and Etsy do.\n Here are reasons some people believe Amazon does not accept cryptocurrency and a way for you to use yours to shop there.\nKey TakeawaysBitcoin has been around since 2009, gaining increased attention and adoption, yet Amazon still does not accept cryptocurrency as payment.Though the company has never directly stated why, there's plenty of speculation about its reasons\u2014such as prioritizing payment agreements already in place or that it may launch its own digital currency.If you feel you must use Bitcoin to make an Amazon purchase, you can buy prepaid Amazon gift cards online with your Bitcoin.Using Bitcoin for purchases creates a taxable event, so if you use it to buy a gift card, make sure you account for that. Why Amazon Does Not Accept Bitcoin  Amazon has not provided explicit reasons why it does not accept Bitcoin, but there has been plenty of speculation as to what they might be.\n Volatility, Regulation  The price of Bitcoin is more volatile than the price of many other government currencies accepted by Amazon, so there could be some challenges in terms of pricing products. The uncertainty about future cryptocurrency regulation might also be keeping Amazon at bay, as might the difficulty of processing returns considering Bitcoin's wild price fluctuations.\n Current Agreements  It is possible that Amazon already has great deals in place with major credit card companies, such as Visa (V) and other payment processors. Smaller online retailers don't usually operate amid such favorable conditions, which creates a competitive advantage for Amazon.\n Jeff Bezos  One theory is that Amazon founder Jeff Bezos is not a fan of Bitcoin, possibly because he is\u00a0opposed to its unregulated and anonymous nature. This theory gained some traction after The Washington Post, which Bezos\u00a0owns, published a particularly critical article in January 2016 titled \"R.I.P., Bitcoin. It's time to move on.\" However, this, too, is purely speculative. Additionally, Andy Jassy took over as CEO of Amazon in July 2021, and Bezos' personal opinion of Bitcoin may hold less sway for Amazon in the future. Digital Currency Rival  Another\u00a0theory is that Amazon would like to eventually roll out its own digital currency. If that were the case, Amazon would likely avoid lending credibility to Bitcoin or open up its huge market to a competitor. However, it has created the Amazon Managed Blockchain (AMB), which is designed for Web3 applications and development.\nFast FactAmazon launched Amazon Coins in 2013 for games, apps, and in-app purchases, but there has been no other cryptocurrency-like development activity publicized. How to Make Amazon Purchases Using Bitcoin  Even though Amazon does not accept Bitcoin, it does accept gift cards. Amazon digital gift cards act just like U.S. dollars and can be applied to all product purchases. Some gift card hubs, such as Gyft and BitPay, let you pay for their digital cards with Bitcoin. This process adds steps and expenses, but it is the quickest workaround to a direct Amazon option. Tax and Fee Considerations  It's important to understand the tax implications of using Bitcoin to make purchases because it can add to how much you spend. The Internal Revenue Service considers cryptocurrency property\u2014and when property is sold, it is a taxable event.\n When you use your Bitcoin to buy something, you create a taxable event, and your cryptocurrency will have appreciated or depreciated in price. If you use Bitcoin you've held for more than one year to buy a gift card, you trigger a capital gains tax event and will need to report it and pay the IRS if there is a gain. If there is a loss, you report a loss. If you've owned the bitcoin you spend for less than one year, it is a short-term capital gain or loss and must reported as a gain or loss in income.\n You'll need to know how much you paid for it, including fees (called your adjusted basis), and base your tax reporting on that amount. How much you're taxed depends on your income in both scenarios.\n You'll also need to pay network transaction fees when purchasing the gift card, which can vary depending on network traffic and the going rate. Additionally, you'll pay sales tax when you make the purchase on Amazon with the card.\n So, when you use Bitcoin to buy an Amazon gift card and then use the card, you'll pay the following in addition to the purchase price of the items:\nCapital gains taxNetwork transaction feesSales taxWhat Crypto Works With Amazon?Amazon, for unknown reasons, does not accept cryptocurrency.Does Amazon Accept Bitcoin?Amazon does not accept Bitcoin as of Nov. 9, 2024.Who Accepts Bitcoin Payments?Many retailers, merchants, and businesses accept Bitcoin payments. To find out if your favorite stores and companies accept Bitcoin, look for their accepted payments webpage. The Bottom Line  Amazon, so far, has resisted the temptation to accept Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as payment for goods and services. However, you can use your cryptocurrency to make purchases on Amazon, but you'll need to buy a gift card first and use it to make the purchase. Keep in mind the additional taxes and fees you'll need to account for when buying a gift card with your crypto.", "tags": ["www.investopedia.com", "articles", "wwwinvestopediacom"]}

Amgen (AMGN) shares surged more than 12% in premarket trading Friday after the biopharmaceutical giant posted quarterly earnings that came in ahead of Wall Street expectations and provided a positive update about trials of its injectable weight-loss drug MariTide. For the quarter ending March 31, the Thousand Oaks, California-based drugmaker disclosed adjusted earnings of $3.96 per share, edging ahead of the $3.88-a-share figure expected by analysts. Revenue in the period grew 22% from a year earlier to $7.4 billion and met the Street forecast. A Weight-Loss Drug To Rival Ozempic, Wegovy?  The company announced it would give up pursuit of an oral weight-loss pill AMG786, instead focusing its resources on the development of its highly anticipated injectable MariTide.\n CEO Robert Bradway told analysts on the company's earnings call that the drugmaker had completed interim analysis of the phase two study and were very encouraged with the results so far.\n The company said it expects more complete data from MariTide's phase two studies toward the end of the year, adding that plans for a comprehensive phase three program remain on schedule. If approved, Amgen aims to offer MariTide via a convenient, auto-injector device at a monthly or less frequent intervals. Simply put, the drug works by activating a hormone that signals a feeling of fullness and blocking another hormone that stores fat, helping a patient to lose weight. MariTide could compete with highly successful weight-loss drugs Ozempic, Wegovy, and Zepbound manufactured by pharmaceutical giants Novo Nordisk (NVO) and Eli Lilly (LLY) in a market some analysts see reaching $100 billion by 2030.\n \"Even modest market share assumptions in this large market may make investors more and more comfortable,\" Evercore ISI analyst Umer Raffat wrote in a note cited by Reuters. Level to Watch Post Earnings Jump  Taking a look at the weekly chart, a recent pullback in Amgen shares found support around $261 from the 50-week moving average and a horizontal line connecting price action dating back to June 2020.\n Investors should keep an eye on the $330 level, an area where the stock may encounter overhead resistance from its all-time high (ATH) set in early February. A convincing breakout above this closely-watched level would likely see the stock\u2019s longer-term uptrend continue.\n Amgen shares were up 12.6% at $313.32 about ten minutes before Friday's opening bell.\nThe comments, opinions, and analyses expressed on Investopedia are for informational purposes only.

{"url": "https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/061715/private-jet-charter-vs-first-class-whats-best.asp", "title": "Private Jet Charter vs. First-Class: What's the Difference?", "text": " Private Jet Charter vs. First-Class: An Overview  Private jet charters and first class are two different modes of air travel. Both require the traveler to pay a great deal of money for the privilege of boarding. While they may seem similar, these two types of air travel are distinctly different.\nChartering a private jet allows you to maximize your time at your destination and minimize the number of hours you spend traveling, while flying first-class means you are still at the mercy of taking the route of a commercial airline.\n Private jets give you the luxury of flying on your own or with a group. However, going first-class means you still have to put up with crowds at airport security and other discomforts of commercial flights.\n Some people may give you flak for asking the question, but if you have the disposable income to spend on air travel, it's worth considering either option. Keep reading to learn more about the differences between taking a private jet and flying first class.\nKey TakeawaysFlying on a private jet or first class can be expensive, but both offer luxuries unavailable in the economy cabin of a commercial flight.Private planes offer more individualized amenities to passengers than first-class flights.First-class may be much more affordable than a private jet if you fly overseas.Flying first-class is generally less expensive than buying a seat on a charter jet if you fly alone. Private Jet Charter  Private jets are for customers in the high-end travel industry. As the name implies, it involves hiring a private jet to travel to your destination. This allows the party making the reservation to control who boards the flight, whether that's friends, families, or colleagues in the case of corporate travel. Chartering a jet can be costly, but certain perks go along with it.\n First, chartered flights offer passengers a great deal of luxury and convenience. This allows individuals to avoid the hassles of dealing with the crowds and security at the airport that people who fly commercial airlines must go through.\n It's also a time saver because travelers who charter flights can set up their own flight timetable, which means they set the departure time. These individuals also don't have to deal with layovers and flight changes. The onboard experience on a chartered flight is also tailored to give flyers a more personal experience. This also includes the amenities that are on board. For instance, travelers can choose their own flight crew, may be given catered meals, and have access to technology and entertainment systems. And since there are far fewer passengers, travelers have more room to move freely throughout the flight. Charters are fairly common for corporate and other business travelers, which allows them to conduct business while in the air or to accommodate their busy schedules. In some cases, private jets allow goods and services to be transported between companies and their customers. Other people who frequently charter private jets include celebrities and athletes.\nImportantJoining a loyalty program and using a cash back or travel credit card can help lower travel costs, whether that's on a private jet or for a first-class ticket on a commercial airline. First-Class  Just like charter flights, flying first-class costs more money than purchasing a flight in the economy section. But unlike private jets, first-class travelers have to go by the airline's schedule. This means they have to go through airport security and deal with crowds, layovers, delays, and long lines at the terminal.\n True, first-class flying on a commercial aircraft comes with amenities. They benefit from priority boarding, which means they skip the line to get on board. They are seated in a reserved section at the front of the plane and are given certain perks, including free beverages and meals, larger seats, more legroom, and other benefits.\n In many cases, airlines customize their seating to provide passengers with the most comfort, including sleeper seats. The services that come with first-class flying, though, are generally not at the level or personalization of flying privately.\n Long trips require a larger, more expensive plane with a bigger range. Although it is an expensive form of travel, it is considerably cheaper than hiring your own plane unless you took a very large group with you on the charter and would have otherwise bought everyone first-class seats.\n Commercial aircraft only have access to the largest airports. If the traveler is flying to attend a meeting well outside the nearest metropolitan area, they need to add significant round-trip driving time to get from the metro airport to the meeting location.NoteWhen weighing fare options, consider business class as well, which can offer luxury perks and amenities while costing less than first-class. Key Differences  While we've laid out some of the most obvious differences between flying on a private jet and flying first class on a commercial airline, there are very obvious distinctions between them. Here are some of the most obvious ones.\n Cost  One of the main differences between these two forms of travel is the cost. Chartering a private jet can cost anywhere between $2,000 and $18,000 per hour, even up to $30,000 an hour for a VIP Airliner. The cost can get very high, though it depends on a certain number of factors, including:\nThe destinationThe amenities requiredWhether the plane and crew need to wait for the travelerThe size of the plane, where smaller planes cost less to hire For example, a light jet might cost $9,000 to $11,000 for a three-hour trip. However, popular destinations can sometimes cost more. A three-hour flight to Palm Beach, Florida, from New York City might cost as much as $20,000 for a light jet and up to $30,000 via a mid-size jet. The cost can vary, depending on the number of seats on the plane, the amenities, and how many staff are required. First-class reservations on commercial flights can cost about $1,300 for domestic flights and higher for international destinations. The cost also depends on the airline itself\u2014some charge more because they have more amenities available to those who are willing to shell out more money for air travel.\n When traveling, consider travel insurance, particularly if the trip is expensive. On a commercial aircraft, you rent a seat. If you want to bring somebody with you, you rent two seats and pay double the cost. With charters, on the other hand, you rent the plane.\n Accommodations  Customers who fly privately also have the luxury of bringing a lot more with them to their destination. This includes pets, sporting equipment, and other bulky items that don\u2019t easily fit on commercial aircraft. They also avoid the risk of losing these items in checked baggage. First-class flyers, on the other hand, are limited in how many bags they can bring on board. But they may be given a more flexible weight allowance than those in other cabins. And while other passengers may have to pay to check in their bags, first-class passengers are normally exempt from paying.\n Accommodations don't just mean the bag allowance. While commercial airlines do as much as they can to be more accessible, private planes may provide easier access for elderly, handicapped, or injured travelers. They are also usually better equipped to handle wheelchairs and other equipment.\nTipIf you prefer flying privately, you may consider investing in a private jet membership that offers guaranteed access to a private plane in exchange for an annual or monthly membership fee. Special Considerations  To the average onlooker, it\u2019s easy to see a private jet flying as excessive. What makes it more economical is when you factor in the value of a person\u2019s time.\n Private jets are able to fly into smaller airports, often getting their clients to their location faster. In addition, flyers don't have to wait in long security lines at large airports, which can be time-consuming even for those with Trusted Traveler status.\n Because companies don\u2019t want to fly their jets without passengers, they are often happy to wait for passengers flying back the same day. This gives flyers more flexibility in their schedules and allows executives to conduct business meetings and work more easily, so flight time isn't wasted. This often makes them more economical than commercial aircraft.\n There\u2019s also the reliability factor. Not making it to an important meeting because a flight was canceled is a risk some people cannot and won't take. It's likely that most people who charter flights do so because they just don\u2019t want the hassle of flying commercially, and money is no object.\nIs a Private Jet More Expensive than Flying First Class?Chartering a private jet can cost between $2,000 and $18,000 per hour. The cost varies depending on the size of the plane, the number of seats, the staff needed, and the amenities. For example, a three-hour trip in a light jet might cost up to $11,000, while the cost jumps to $20,000 for a mid-size jet.First-class reservations on commercial flights can cost about $1,300 for domestic flights, with international flights costing more. Also, first-class costs can add up, depending on the airline and the amenities.What Are the Benefits of Chartering a Private Jet?The onboard experience on a chartered flight is tailored and includes more amenities, such as catered meals and access to technology and entertainment systems. You may also choose your own flight crew and make your own flight timetable and departure time. Also, there are no airport crowds, layovers, or flight changes when flying via a private jet.Do You Have to Go Through TSA Security for a Chartered Flight?Privately chartered flights do not have to go through the Transportation Security Administration's security checkpoints if the plane has fewer than 61 passengers. The Bottom Line  Whether it makes sense to charter a private jet or fly commercial in first- or business class can depend on your individual needs and travel budget. While a chartered flight may cost more, it offers more benefits than typical commercial flights.\n If you do decide to fly first-class or business class, take time to compare the best airline rewards credit cards that can help you earn points or miles toward future flights.\n", "tags": ["www.investopedia.com", "articles", "wwwinvestopediacom"]}

Average annual growth rate (AAGR) is the mean increase in the value of an individual investment, portfolio, asset, or cash flow on an annualized basis. It represents the arithmetic mean of a series of growth rates, is expressed as a percentage, and doesn't factor in compounding.\n AAGR is a widely used metric. Among other things, it is commonly used to analyze a country's gross domestic product (GDP), a company's revenues or profits, and the performance of an investment, such as a mutual fund or stock.\nKey TakeawaysAverage annual growth rate (AAGR) is the average annualized return of an investment, portfolio, asset, or cash flow over time.It is used to analyze various financial metrics, including a company\u2019s financials, economic indicators such as GDP, and investment returns.AAGR is calculated by taking the simple arithmetic mean of a series of returns.It provides a simple and useful way to measure and compare performance over several years but does not account for the effects of compounding.Drawbacks include its sensitivity to outliers and fluctuations and giving the impression of a constant rate of growth.

It is a metric that\u2019s commonly used to assess the performance of investments, businesses, and economies over several years.\n AAGR tells us the mean annualized rate of growth of the subject. It is calculated by adding the individual growth rates together and then dividing the resulting figure by the total number of time periods. AAGR is easy to calculate, smooths out fluctuations, and facilitates comparison across different datasets and timeframes.\nTipThe periods used should all be of equal length\u2014for instance, years, months, or weeks. AAGR is used to analyze various financial metrics, including a company\u2019s revenue, profit, and market share, economic indicators such as GDP and employment rates, and investment returns. AAGR can be calculated for any investment, but it will not include any measure of the investment's overall risk, as measured by its price volatility. Furthermore, the AAGR does not account for periodic compounding. AAGR Examples  The AAGR measures the average rate of return or growth over a series of equally spaced time periods. Here are two examples.Financial InvestmentAssume an investment has the following values over the course of four years:Beginning value = $100,000End of year 1 value = $120,000End of year 2 value = $135,000End of year 3 value = $160,000End of year 4 value = $200,000The formula to determine the percentage growth for each year is:Simple\u00a0percentage\u00a0growth\u00a0or\u00a0return=ending\u00a0valuebeginning\u00a0value\u22121\n\\text{Simple percentage growth or return} = \\frac{\\text{ending value}}{\\text{beginning value}} - 1\nSimple\u00a0percentage\u00a0growth\u00a0or\u00a0return=beginning\u00a0valueending\u00a0value\u200b\u22121Thus, the growth rates for each of the years are as follows:Year 1 growth = $120,000 / $100,000 - 1 = 20%Year 2 growth = $135,000 / $120,000 - 1 = 12.5%Year 3 growth = $160,000 / $135,000 - 1 = 18.5%Year 4 growth = $200,000 / $160,000 - 1 = 25%The AAGR is calculated as the sum of each year's growth rate divided by the number of years:AAGR=20%+12.5%+18.5%+25%4=19%\nAAGR = \\frac{20 \\% + 12.5 \\% + 18.5 \\% + 25 \\%}{4} = 19\\%\nAAGR=420%+12.5%+18.5%+25%\u200b=19%In financial and accounting settings, the beginning and ending prices are usually used. Some analysts may prefer to use average prices when calculating the AAGR depending on what is being analyzed.Gross Domestic Product (GDP) GrowthAs another example, consider the five-year real GDP growth of the United States over the last five years.The U.S. real GDP growth rates for 2019 through 2023 were 2.5%, -2.2%, 5.8%, 1.9%, and 2.5%, respectively. Thus, the AAGR of U.S. real GDP over the last five years has been 2.1%, or (2.5% - 2.2% + 5.8% + 1.9% + 2.5%) /5. AAGR vs. Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR)  AAGR is a linear measure that does not account for the effects of compounding. The above financial investment example showed that growth over four years averaged 19% per year. The AAGR is useful for showing trends; however, it can be misleading to analysts because it does not accurately depict changing financials. In some instances, it can overestimate the growth of an investment.\n For example, consider an end-of-year value for year five of $100,000 for the AAGR example above.\u00a0The percentage growth rate for year five is -50%.\u00a0The resulting AAGR would be 5.2%; however, it is evident from the beginning value of year one and the ending value of year five, the performance yields a 0% return.\u00a0Depending on the situation, it may be more useful to calculate the compound annual growth rate (CAGR).\n The CAGR smooths out an investment's returns or diminishes the effect of the volatility of periodic returns.\u00a0\n Formula for CAGR CAGR=Ending\u00a0BalanceBeginning\u00a0Balance1#\u00a0Years\u22121\nCAGR = \\frac{\\text{Ending Balance}}{\\text{Beginning Balance}}^{\\frac{1}{\\text{\\# Years}}} - 1\nCAGR=Beginning\u00a0BalanceEnding\u00a0Balance\u200b#\u00a0Years1\u200b\u22121Using the above example for years one through four, the CAGR equals:CAGR=$200,000$100,00014\u22121=18.92%\nCAGR = \\frac{\\$200,000}{\\$100,000}^{\\frac{1}{4}}- 1 = 18.92\\%\nCAGR=$100,000$200,000\u200b41\u200b\u22121=18.92%For the first four years, the AAGR and CAGR are close to one another. However, if year five were to be factored into the CAGR equation (-50%), the result would end up being 0%, which sharply contrasts the result from the AAGR of 5.2%.\n Limitations of the AAGR  AAGR is a simple average of periodic annual returns. Though useful, this growth measure also contains flaws, which are important to be aware of.\n Issues include its sensitivity to outliers and fluctuations and giving the impression of a constant rate of growth over the observation period, which may not be the case. Another drawback of using AAGR to examine investment opportunities is that it does not take account of risk. One investment may have a slightly higher AAGR but be much more volatile and risky.\nWhat Does the Average Annual Growth Rate (AAGR) Tell You?The average annual growth rate (AAGR) identifies long-term trends of financial measures such as cash flows or investment returns. AAGR tells you what the annual return has been on average, but it does not take into account compounding.What Are the Limitations of Average Annual Growth Rate?AAGR may overestimate the growth rate if there are both positive and negative returns. It also does not include any measure of the risk involved, such as price volatility, or factor in the timing of returns.How Does Average Annual Growth Rate Differ From Compounded Annual Growth Rate (CAGR)?Average annual growth rate (AAGR) is the average increase. It is a linear measure and does not take into account compounding. Meanwhile, the compound annual growth rate (CAGR) does and it smooths out an investment's returns, diminishing the effect of return volatility.How Do You Calculate the Average Annual Growth Rate (AAGR)?The average annual growth rate (AAGR) is calculated by getting the growth rate for each time period, adding them together, and then dividing the resulting figure by the total number of time periods. The Bottom Line  The average annual growth rate (AAGR) provides the arithmetic mean of a series of growth rates and is commonly used in finance as an indicator of performance and a comparative tool. With a simple calculation, AAGR lets you see\u00a0the average annualized return of a subject over multiple years. However, its simplicity also carries drawbacks and makes relying solely on this measure to make decisions a bad idea.", "tags": ["www.investopedia.com", "terms", "wwwinvestopediacom"]}
{"url": "https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bayes-theorem.asp", "title": "Bayes' Theorem: What It Is, Formula, and Examples", "text": " What Is Bayes' Theorem?  Bayes' Theorem,\u00a0named after 18th-century British mathematician Thomas Bayes, is a mathematical formula for determining conditional probability. Conditional probability is the likelihood of an outcome occurring based on a previous outcome in similar circumstances.\u00a0Bayes' Theorem provides a way to revise existing predictions or theories (update probabilities) given new or additional evidence.\n In finance, Bayes' Theorem can be used to rate the risk of lending money to potential borrowers. The theorem is also called Bayes' Rule or Bayes' Law and is the foundation of the field of Bayesian statistics.\nKey TakeawaysBayes' Theorem allows you to update the predicted probabilities of an event by incorporating new information.Bayes' Theorem was named after 18th-century mathematician Thomas Bayes.It is often employed in finance to calculate or update risk evaluation.Investopedia / Lara Antal Understanding Bayes' Theorem  Applications of Bayes' Theorem are widespread and not limited to the financial realm. For example, Bayes' theorem can be used to determine the accuracy of medical test results by taking into consideration how likely any given person is to have a disease and the general accuracy of the test. Bayes' theorem relies on incorporating prior probability distributions in order to generate posterior probabilities.\n In Bayesian statistical inference, prior probability is the probability of an event occurring before new data is collected. In other words, it represents the best rational assessment of the probability of a particular outcome based on current knowledge before an experiment is performed.\n Posterior probability is the revised probability of an event occurring after considering the new information. Posterior probability is calculated by updating the\u00a0prior probability\u00a0using\u00a0Bayes' theorem. Put another way, the posterior probability is the probability of event A occurring, given that event B has occurred.\n Special Considerations  Bayes' Theorem gives the probability of an event based on new information that is or may be related to that event. The formula also can be used to determine how the probability of an event occurring may be affected by hypothetical new information, supposing the new information will turn out to be true.\nExample: A Deck of CardsConsider drawing a single card from a complete deck of 52 cards. There are four kings in the deck, so the probability that the card is a king is four divided by 52, which equals 1/13 or approximately 7.69%. Now, suppose it is revealed that the selected card is a face card. The probability the selected card is a king, given it is a face card, is four divided by 12, or approximately 33.3%, as there are 12 face cards in a deck. Formula for Bayes' Theorem P(A\u2223B)=P(A\u22c2B)P(B)=P(A)\u22c5P(B\u2223A)P(B)where:P(A)=\u00a0The\u00a0probability\u00a0of\u00a0A\u00a0occurringP(B)=\u00a0The\u00a0probability\u00a0of\u00a0B\u00a0occurringP(A\u2223B)=The\u00a0probability\u00a0of\u00a0A\u00a0given\u00a0BP(B\u2223A)=\u00a0The\u00a0probability\u00a0of\u00a0B\u00a0given\u00a0AP(A\u22c2B))=\u00a0The\u00a0probability\u00a0of\u00a0both\u00a0A\u00a0and\u00a0B\u00a0occurring\n\\begin{aligned} &P\\left(A|B\\right)=\\frac{P\\left(A\\bigcap{B}\\right)}{P\\left(B\\right)}=\\frac{P\\left(A\\right)\\cdot{P\\left(B|A\\right)}}{P\\left(B\\right)}\\\\ &\\textbf{where:}\\\\ &P\\left(A\\right)=\\text{ The probability of A occurring}\\\\ &P\\left(B\\right)=\\text{ The probability of B occurring}\\\\ &P\\left(A|B\\right)=\\text{The probability of A given B}\\\\ &P\\left(B|A\\right)=\\text{ The probability of B given A}\\\\ &P\\left(A\\bigcap{B}\\right))=\\text{ The probability of both A and B occurring}\\\\ \\end{aligned}\n\u200bP(A\u2223B)=P(B)P(A\u22c2B)\u200b=P(B)P(A)\u22c5P(B\u2223A)\u200bwhere:P(A)=\u00a0The\u00a0probability\u00a0of\u00a0A\u00a0occurringP(B)=\u00a0The\u00a0probability\u00a0of\u00a0B\u00a0occurringP(A\u2223B)=The\u00a0probability\u00a0of\u00a0A\u00a0given\u00a0BP(B\u2223A)=\u00a0The\u00a0probability\u00a0of\u00a0B\u00a0given\u00a0AP(A\u22c2B))=\u00a0The\u00a0probability\u00a0of\u00a0both\u00a0A\u00a0and\u00a0B\u00a0occurring\u200b Examples of Bayes' Theorem  Below are two examples of Bayes' Theorem. The first example shows how the formula can be derived from a stock investing example using Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN). The second example applies Bayes' Theorem to pharmaceutical drug testing.\n Deriving the Bayes' Theorem Formula  Bayes' Theorem follows from the axioms of conditional probability, which is the probability of an event given that another event occurred. For example, a simple probability question may ask: \"What is the probability of\u00a0Amazon's stock price falling?\" Conditional probability takes this question a step further by asking: \"What is the probability of Amazon's stock price falling given that the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) index fell earlier?\"\n The conditional probability of A, given that B has happened, can be expressed as:\n If A is: \"AMZN price falls\" then P(AMZN) is the probability that AMZN falls; and B is: \"The DJIA is already down,\" and P(DJIA) is the probability that the DJIA fell; then the conditional probability expression reads as \"the probability that AMZN drops given a DJIA decline is equal to the probability that AMZN price declines and DJIA declines over the probability of a decrease in the DJIA index.\n P(AMZN|DJIA) = P(AMZN and DJIA) / P(DJIA)\n P(AMZN and DJIA) is the probability of both\u00a0A and\u00a0B occurring. This is the same as the probability of\u00a0A occurring multiplied by the probability that\u00a0B occurs given that A occurs, expressed as P(AMZN) x P(DJIA|AMZN). The fact that these two expressions are equal leads to Bayes' Theorem, which is written as:\n if: P(AMZN and DJIA) = P(AMZN) x P(DJIA|AMZN) = P(DJIA) x P(AMZN|DJIA)\n then: P(AMZN|DJIA) = [P(AMZN) x P(DJIA|AMZN)] / P(DJIA).\n P(AMZN) and P(DJIA) are the probabilities that Amazon and the Dow have fallen independently of each other.\n The formula explains the relationship between the probability of the hypothesis before seeing the evidence that P(AMZN) and the probability of the hypothesis after getting the evidence P(AMZN|DJIA), given a hypothesis for Amazon given evidence in the Dow.\n Numerical Example of Bayes' Theorem  As a numerical example, imagine there is a drug test that is 98% accurate, meaning that 98% of the time, it shows a true positive result for someone using the drug, and 98% of the time, it shows a true negative result for nonusers of the drug. Next, assume 0.5% of people use the drug. If a person selected at random tests positive for the drug, the following calculation can be made to determine the probability the person is actually a user of the drug where the terms are:\nA = Probability that a positive test result is trueB = Percent of people that use the drugA x B = the probability that a positive test result is true( 1 - A ) x ( 1 - B ) = Probability that a negative test result is true The formula would look like this:\n ( A x B ) / [ ( A x B ) + { ( 1 - A ) x ( 1 - B ) } ] = Probability of taking the drug\n Using the values, the calculation works out as follows: ( 0.98 x 0.005 ) / [ ( 0.98 x 0.005 ) + { ( 1 - 0.98 ) x ( 1 - 0.005 ) } ] =\n 0.0049 / ( 0.0049 + 0.0199 ) = 19.76%\n Bayes' Theorem shows that even if a person tested positive in this scenario, there is a 19.76% chance the person takes the drug and an 80.24% chance they don't.What Is the Bayes' Rule Used for?The Bayes' rule is used to update a probability with an updated conditional variable. Investment analysts use it to forecast probabilities in the stock market, but it is also used in many other contexts.Why Is Bayes' Theorem So Powerful?Mathematically, Bayes' Theorem shows that two probabilities are equal. Used in statistics, investing, or other contexts, Bayes' Theorem allows you to view conditional probabilities. This means that you can find the likelihood of something happening with an additional piece of information (a condition) taken into account.How Do You Know When to Use Bayes' Theorem?If you need to determine the probability of something occuring given that another condition exists that can influence the occurence, you would use Bayes' theorem. The Bottom Line  Bayes' Theorem allows you to assess the likelihood of something happening when something else is taken into account.\n For example, it takes a test result and relates it to the conditional probability of that test result given other related events. For high-probability false positives, the theorem gives a more reasoned likelihood of a particular outcome.\n", "tags": ["www.investopedia.com", "terms", "wwwinvestopediacom"]}

For investors and traders of all levels, however, the Fidelity Investments app is a well-designed, user-friendly platform that provides access to a comprehensive account overview, trading capabilities, Fidelity\u2019s premier research, and more on Apple, Android, and Amazon devices.\n The Classic version of the Fidelity Investment app was phased out in June 2024, making way for the latest version. Like many of its competitors, Fidelity has used customer feedback to create a new version that is not only more intuitive but also replete with the key features and tools that make for a great mobile trading and account management experience. The new app is smartly designed, offering enhancements with a multi-screen trade experience, increased customization, enhanced options trading, and more, all while continuing to give customers access to an expansive list of key full-service features that caused us to name Fidelity the best overall online broker, as well as best for low costs, best for ETFs, and best for cash management.\n Best App for Saving: Acorns Open an AccountAccount Minimum: $0\nFees: Bronze: $3/month, Silver: $6/month, Gold: $12/month\nRead full reviewOpen an Account Why We Chose It  Acorns\u2019s Round-Ups\u00ae product is an effective way for savers to automatically redirect spare change into investment dollars, allowing those small sums to reach their full growth potential. For even faster growth, users can use Acorns\u2019 Round-Ups Multiplier to multiply their savings.\n Pros & Cons ProsLow-fee, diversified investment portfolio optionsInvest \u201cspare change\u201d with easeMultiplier feature enables faster investment growthNo hidden transaction fees$0 account minimumConsFees can be a large percentage of small account valueLimited investment selectionNo tax-loss harvestingConsistent saving and investing required to build a meaningful investment amount Overview  Founded in 2012 by four colleagues, including the father-son team of Jeff Cruttenden and Walter Cruttenden, in Irvine, California, Acorns is a unique digital wealth management platform designed to make it easy for individuals to start investing and saving. At the core of Acorns\u2019 strategy is its Round-Ups feature, which enables users to automatically invest their \u201cspare change\u201d with every debit or credit card purchase, although the company also ventures into other products, such as Acorns Later, an IRA that comes with a 3% match for Gold-tiered clients.\u00a0\n Acorns offers investing, saving, and banking all in one place, and users of both iOS and Android devices will appreciate that the platform\u2019s desktop functionality is mirrored on their phones. The Acorns app makes it easy to perform common tasks like setting up an account, making changes to your account, and utilizing the Round-Ups feature to automatically round up purchases to the next dollar and invest the leftover change. Customers who sign up for an Acorns debit card will benefit from automatic, real-time round-ups of their spare change on purchases they make, compared to having to wait for round-ups to reach a minimum of $5 when using a linked external checking account or credit card.\n Like many financial apps these days, Acorns also allows mobile users to deposit checks. In fact, this is the only way for users to make check deposits, since Acorns does not offer users the ability to cash or deposit checks via any of the 55,000+ no-fee ATMs within the AllPoint Network. It\u2019s important to understand, however, that, for small accounts, the monthly fees could outweigh the savings feature, depending upon the investor\u2019s level of use.\n The Bottom Line  Our exhaustive research has found that E*TRADE is our overall pick for the best investment and trading app because of how it optimizes its mobile platforms to include the right selection of research and account amenities, intuitive and user-friendly navigation, complex trading technology, and more. Active traders will find that Interactive Brokers\u2019 legacy of providing industry-leading advanced trading capabilities carries over to the company\u2019s mobile platform, while options traders will revel in the platform\u2019s innovative, yet easy-to-use tools.\u00a0\u00a0\n Although Fidelity and Webull both offer market participants low-cost trading options, these companies are at the opposite ends of the spectrum when it comes to account amenities and trading execution. Fidelity\u2019s mobile platform is best suited for beginner and more casual experienced traders as well as all levels of investors looking for access to superior investing tools, research, and full-service brokerage features on the go, while Webull delivers an advanced, though user-friendly mobile trading platform for active traders looking for $0 commission for trading stocks, ETFs, and options.\n Finally, Wealthfront and Acorns are both award-winning robo-advisor platforms. Wealthfront\u2019s industry-best automated portfolio management, goals-based asset allocation, and access to banking and investing tools make it well-suited for investors seeking the best automated investment experience. Acorns, on the other hand, specializes in delivering on-the-go functionality to investors looking for a recurring savings plan with the unique ability to allocate change left over on purchases to passive income or growth opportunities.\n Compare the Best Investment Apps Company\u00a0FeesAccount MinimumE*TRADE Best OverallNo commission for stock, ETF, and mutual fund trades.

Why You Should Trust Us  Investopedia collected and analyzed several criteria that are the most important to readers choosing the right mobile app to fit their investing and trading needs. We used this data to evaluate a total of 49 online brokerage and digital wealth management platforms based on their mobile usability and functionality, and other features to provide unbiased, comprehensive reviews to ensure our readers make the right decision for their needs. Investopedia launched in 1999 and has been helping readers find the best investment apps since 2019.\nEverything You Need to Know About Brokerage Accounts How to Choose an Investment App  Now that you know the best investment apps, the next step is choosing the best investment app for you. However, everyone has different financial goals and needs that they alone must consider. Below are some key considerations you will need to factor in when choosing an investment app:\nYour investing style: Are you the type of trader who wants to utilize sophisticated indicators and trading strategies? If that's your objective, an app like Wealthfront wouldn't be a good fit. In this case, you would be better off going with an app like Interactive Brokers. However, if you are the type of investor who wants an app to do all the work for you, then Wealthfront is the clear winner.\u00a0Fees and costs:The investment app you choose should be cost-effective for your financial needs. For instance, Wealthfront is an excellent service. However, its 0.25% annual fee, although small in the grand scheme of things, does add up the longer you have the account and the more it compounds in size. Investors who want to pay $0 in stock trades with low costs for options trades may want to consider Interactive Brokers or Webull.Investment options: When choosing an investment app, you will want to easily fund your account and buy and sell stocks, ETFs, mutual funds, cryptocurrency, options, and futures smoothly and seamlessly.\u00a0 Choosing the right investment app that fits your needs is critical to you reaching your financial goals. Cost, functionality, and your particular trading style are all important considerations when making your decision. How to Get Started With Investing Apps  Investing apps can be a convenient way to start investing in the financial markets. Luckily, getting started on this journey is as easy as following these key steps.\n Step 1: Define your investment goals  Clearly define your financial objectives and risk tolerance. Whether your aim is long-term investing, short-term gains, or a mix, understanding your goals is crucial to establishing a strong foundation for choosing the right platform to fit your needs.\n Step 2: Research and choose an investment app\u00a0  When researching the various investment apps that are available, consider factors like the user interface, fees, available investment options, investing tools, and customer service.\n Step 3: Download and install the app\u00a0  Once you've identified the right app that aligns with your investment goals, download and install the app.\n Step 4: Set up your account\u00a0  Open the app and begin the account creation process. Provide necessary personal information, including your name, address, and Social Security number. Verify your identity by submitting required documents.\n Step 5: Fund your account\u00a0  Connect your investment app to your bank account. This enables you to transfer funds seamlessly for investing purposes. Step 6: Explore investment options Familiarize yourself with the various investment products available. Stock investing, along with bond, ETF, and mutual funds investing, are common choices, but it is critical for you to choose an investment vehicle based on your risk appetite and investment strategy.\n Step 7: Start small\u00a0  Begin with a small investment to get comfortable with the app's functionality. You should also learn by using the paper trading function that many of the top platforms now offer. From there, as your confidence and experience start to build, begin to increase your investments gradually.\n Step 8: Monitor your investments  Regularly check your investment portfolio within the app. Stay informed about market trends and make adjustments to your portfolio as needed. Pros and Cons of Using Investment Apps  Investment apps are sophisticated software systems that allow investors to conduct their trading on a mobile platform right in the palm of their hand. Although there are many pros to using investment apps to secure your financial future, there are also cons that investors need to note before using these platforms.\n Pros Convenience: Investment apps allow investors to easily log in to their financial account and make necessary adjustments anywhere in the world.\u00a0Beginner-friendliness: Most investment apps are much easier to use and require a lower learning curve than the desktop versions. Generally, investors won\u2019t be inundated with a complex layout or weighed down by many options to handle their finances.Low fees and entry requirements:Investment apps typically have lower costs and more affordable entry requirements than desktop investing software. Many investment apps are free or have a $0 minimum to open an account. Wealthfront is an exception, as it requires $500 to open an account and charges fees upward of 0.25%. However, it also offers one of the best hands-off services in the robo-advisor industry, which, to many investors, may be well worth the cost. Cons Limited functionality:Investment apps will operate differently from their desktop counterparts. The investing app may exclude charts, tools, and investing resources essential to the trader's success. However, limitations are specific to each platform and differ in what they offer. When choosing an investing app, ensure it coincides with your trading style.Limited customization: Most desktop-based investing platforms allow investors to fully customize their layout to improve their focus on what matters most to them when they invest. Investing apps may allow some sort of customizability, but in most cases, there are very few options to get it how the investor may want it. Investors are usually limited to the layout provided by the investing app and cannot customize it according to their preferences.Limited customer service: Investing apps may limit customer service resources, and customers may be encouraged to find solutions on their own within the app's resources, such as its FAQs or an online forum. If the investing app does provide customer service, it may not offer ideal solutions to the investor's issues.  Assets That You Can Trade Through an Investment App  Investment apps offer a wide range of financial instruments for market participants to trade and invest in. While the assets available to you will vary across platforms, you can expect that apps provided by traditional online brokers will contain the largest selection. Investments you can expect to find on these mobile platforms include:\nStocksBondsFractional sharesOptionsFuturesETFsMutual fundsIndex fundsCommoditiesCryptocurrenciesForex pairsREITs Even the increasingly popularity no-traditional class of assets known as alternative investments can be traded on certain mobile platforms. When considering a platform for investing in alternatives, however, it's important to note that accredited investor status may be required. How to Start Investing In Stocks  Investing in stocks can be a powerful way to grow wealth, save for retirement or a major purchase, and build a more secure financial future. While the stock market offers the potential for strong returns over time, it also carries risks, especially for newer investors. Careful planning and an educated approach can help you navigate these risks and set yourself up for success. Here are seven essential steps to help you start investing in stocks: Step 1: Set Clear Investment Goals  You need to clearly define your investing timeframe and financial objectives. Shorter-term goals may include saving $100,000 over the next five years for a down payment on a house, while long-term goals might involve aiming to have $1,000,000 saved for retirement 30 years down the road. Having specific, time-bound goals will guide your investment decisions and help you stay disciplined and focused on your strategy.\n Step 2: Determine How Much You Can Afford to Invest  Assess your personal finances and determine how much money you can safely invest without putting yourself in a financially vulnerable position. Before investing, prioritize building an emergency fund, paying off high-interest debt, and creating a budget. Only invest what you can afford to lose. Step 3: Determine Your Risk Tolerance and Investing Style  Do your best to understand how comfortable you are with risk and what levels of portfolio fluctuations you can stomach. Risk tolerance depends on factors such as your investment horizon and objectives, and personal financial situation. Your risk tolerance will determine the stocks you choose.\n Next, decide how involved you want to be with your investments. Some investors prefer a hands-on, active approach, while others may opt for passive-specific investments or utilize professional investment advice. Step 4: Choose an Investment Account  It is crucial to select an investment account that facilitates the achievement of your financial objectives. Generally, your choice will come down to a standard brokerage account or a tax-advantaged retirement account - each having different tax implications and varying investment options. Pick one that best aligns with your financial goals and strategy. Step 5: Fund Your Stock Account  Once your brokerage account is set up, you\u2019ll need to fund it. Common funding methods include bank transfers, check deposits, or transfers from other brokerage accounts. You may also opt in for regular automatic contributions to help build your portfolio consistently over time. Employing strategies like dollar-cost averaging may additionally lower your short-term risks. Step 6: Pick Your Stocks  Do your best to choose stocks that align with your risk tolerance and investment goals. Newer investors may favor blue chip stocks, dividend stocks, or ETFs, and pursue a more conservative, diversified approach. Regardless of your experience level, focus on long-term growth and stability rather than attempting to time the market for quick gains. Step 7: Learn, Monitor, Review  Review your investments on a regular basis and do your best to stay informed about latest market trends and economic conditions. A good way to accomplish that is by reading reputable financial news. Keep learning more about the markets - you can even practice with tools like stock simulators. Adjust your portfolio to keep it aligned with evolving financial goals and market conditions. How Much Money Do You Need to Invest Through an Investment App?  The funding requirements for an investment app, including AI investment apps, will differ with every platform. For instance, Wealthfront is the only investment app covered here that requires a $500 minimum investment to open an account. If you are interested in the robo-advisor sector but find the account minimum too steep, then robo-advisors like Betterment may be a better fit as it requires only $10 to start investing. When it comes to online brokers, top platforms like Interactive Brokers, E*TRADE, Fidelity, and Webull do not require any account minimum. However, investors will need to conduct their due diligence to ensure they can meet all requirements before opening an account.\u00a0\n Desktop vs. Mobile Experiences  Desktop trading platforms still have a strong customer base because of the superior trading experience they provide. Thanks to the growth of app-only retail investors, however, brokers can\u2019t focus solely on the desktop experience. Mobile-first and mobile-only brokerages already exist, and established brokers are having to simultaneously develop their desktop and mobile platforms to keep up.\u00a0\n To do this, many brokerages have changed their product approach to focus on creating a consistent experience across multiple devices. This means you can usually find similar workflows and key tools regardless of which platform you are on. This comes with a trader-specific caveat, as many desktop platforms intended for active traders have to cut out a lot more when transitioning to mobile when compared to brokerages with platforms aimed at average investors.\u00a0\n The extent of this feature reduction has been lessened as the smartphone technology running these trading apps has improved, however, and more brokers are aligning and synchronizing key features across both the mobile and desktop workflows, such as analysis, research, screening tools, money movement, and charting. More recently, complex trading strategies originally reserved for desktop experiences like multi-leg options trades and contingent orders have been enabled on apps as well.\nSurvey InsightAccording to\u00a0Investopedia\u2019s latest Reader Survey, readers still choose individual stocks as their top choice for where they would invest if they had an extra $10,000 on hand, even though their appetite for risk has faded since February. This is followed by ETFs, money market funds, and CDs. Frequently Asked Questions What Is the Best Investment App?Determining the best investment app depends on individual preferences and investing goals. Our research has determined that E*TRADE is the best investment app overall, because it optimizes its mobile platforms to include the right selection of research and account amenities, intuitive and user-friendly navigation, complex trading technology, and more. Ultimately, however, the app you choose should align with your investment strategy, risk tolerance, and financial objectives.What Should I Consider Before Using a Stock Trading App?App-based trading gives you access to financial markets right at your fingertips, wherever you are located. When considering investing through a mobile app it\u2019s helpful to identify your goals, preferences, and investment strategy. Being aware of your personal investment experience and educational opportunities can also help match you to the right trading platform. It is also important to evaluate the broker as a whole, rather than just by the mobile app. A slick app can\u2019t make up for the impact of higher-than-average trading fees and poor execution, for example.\u00a0As you decide between different apps, you may find some platforms provide paper-based accounts that let you experiment with trades without risking your personal capital. Testing out more than one app-based investment offering can also give you more insight to properly compare and contrast features that match your preferences. All these factors can help determine which app will be the right fit for you.What's the Difference Between Finance Apps and Investing Apps?In this review, we are focused on investing apps rather than finance apps. Investing apps allow you to actually buy and sell assets and, in practical terms, are the apps provided by brokerages to trade in your account with them. There is a wider universe of financial apps out there, and some brokerages also offer finance app functions through their investment apps (i.e. external account syncing with financial analysis on your total holdings).The key difference with a finance app is that you cannot trade stocks or assets through those apps even though you may be able to sync your brokerage accounts to the app. In contrast, investment apps enable you to research investments, check positions, and place new orders, all without having to leave the app. Finance apps generally stop at being able to display your brokerage account balance as part of your overall financial picture. Some of the most popular financial apps are budgeting and expense tracking apps, and we review these separately from our investment app reviews.Are Investment Apps Safe?Generally speaking, all investment apps built by major financial institutions are safe to use. Not only do these companies implement high security standards and carry both FDIC insurance and SIPC insurance to safeguard the accounts of those using their mobile application, but\u00a0marketplaces such as the App Store for iOS and Google Play for\u00a0the Android operating systems also have strong security protocols that each app must pass to\u00a0be authorized\u00a0for their marketplace. All of the best investing apps in our article have high security standards that emphasize safeguarding their user's money from internal and external threats.What Is Robinhood?Robinhood is a user-friendly investing and trading app where users can easily trade stocks, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), options, and cryptocurrencies on the platform. A pioneer in offering commission-free trading, Robinhood remains popular among newer investors. However, the platform lacks more sophisticated financial tools, asset categories, and research capabilities that advanced traders look for in a broker.What Is Acorns?Acorns is a robo-advisor best known for its Round-Ups feature. As the name suggests, it rounds up spare change from everyday purchases and invests it into a diversified portfolio of ETFs, while also offering features like automatic rebalancing and dividend reinvestment, portfolio customization, and bonus investments for spending with partner brands. The company primarily targets beginners and those who struggle to save, and provides a user-friendly mobile app for seamless investment and account management, and banking. However, with plans starting at $3/month, its fees can be quite high relative to the small balances typically built through Round-Ups.Which Is Better: Robinhood or Webull?Robinhood and Webull are often thought of as being similar investing platforms. However, our research has uncovered several differences between the two. For instance, Webull's platform offers a far more robust trading experience that includes advanced technical charting capabilities, available quantitative studies, deep market news, fundamental comparison tools, excellent customization, and broad options trading features.Robinhood, on the other hand, delivers a more basic trading experience that makes it a strong investment app for beginners. The company's Learn vertical stands out as a plus in this regard. In addition, Robinhood's 1% match should appeal to investors looking to open a retirement account. Ultimately, our research found that Webull is the best app offered for low-cost options trading and low-cost day trading, in addition to being the\u00a0best low-cost options broker.What Is a Portfolio Tracker?Investment apps allow users to directly invest in and monitor various assets while portfolio trackers enable people to view multiple accounts\u2014such as 401(k)s, IRAs, and checking accounts\u2014held on different platforms in one location. They can be a useful tool for people who want to see their entire portfolio in one place.With a portfolio tracker, you can view your asset allocation, look at investment performance, compare your returns to benchmark indices, and more.\u00a0Some portfolio trackers allow people to link their brokerage and bank accounts to the program while others require users to manually upload information about their investments.\u00a0Portfolio trackers may be available as apps or via a web browser.

{"url": "https://www.investopedia.com/most-expensive-cities-to-retire-in-11727164", "title": "Are You Living In One of These Top 10 Most Expensive Cities to Retire?", "text": " Where you retire can have as much impact on your finances as when. In the U.S., the cost of living varies dramatically from city to city, and those differences either stretch your retirement savings or strain them.\n However, cost isn\u2019t the only factor retirees consider. According to a 2024 survey of Americans nearing retirement age, local happiness narrowly surpassed affordability as their top priority in a retirement destination. With all that in mind, let\u2019s explore 10 American cities that are popular among retirees despite their high cost of living.\nKey TakeawaysHousing is the most significant expense in the average retiree\u2019s budget and the leading factor in a retirement destination\u2019s cost of living.Other determining factors in a city\u2019s affordability include health care, transportation, food, and tax costs.Hidden expenses\u2014like the distance from hospitals and major airports in your retirement destination\u2014can also impact your comfort in retirement.Cities with strong appeal tend to have a higher cost of living, often driven by demand for their amenities or location.The ideal retirement destination should satisfy your practical requirements without sacrificing your ideal lifestyle. Arlington, Virginia  Understanding the Costs  Arlington, VA, is just across the Potomac River from Washington, D.C., and its residents pay a premium for the privilege. The cost of day-to-day expenses like food and transportation is close to typical for the U.S., but Arlington\u2019s elevated housing costs alone make it expensive.\n The median home value in Arlington County is $864,000, more than double the national median of $416,900. Similarly, median monthly housing costs are roughly $2,414, compared to just $1,338 across the country. What Makes the City So Expensive?  Arlington\u2019s location near the nation\u2019s capital drives strong demand for housing. Many residents commute to Washington, D.C., creating continued upward pressure on the local real estate market.\n The city\u2019s high standard of living also contributes to its popularity. Arlington boasts walkable neighborhoods, well-funded public services, and a concentration of white-collar jobs, reflected in the median household income of $140,160\u2014far above the national median of $80,610. Castle Rock, Colorado  Understanding the Costs  Castle Rock is just south of Denver and has become one of the region\u2019s fastest-growing suburbs. Real estate prices\u2014largely driven by demand for an outdoor lifestyle and access to the metro area\u2014make it an increasingly expensive retirement destination.\n The median home value in Castle Rock\u2019s Douglas County is $674,000, while median monthly housing costs are $2,378. Both are more than one and a half times the respective national medians of $416,900 and $1,338 per month.TipGetting around the area is pricier than in other parts of the country. Monthly transportation costs average $1,373, compared to $1,098 nationally. What Makes the City So Expensive?  Castle Rock\u2019s high cost of living is largely due to its proximity to Denver, Colorado\u2019s capital and most populous city. It also appeals to outdoor enthusiasts due to its plentiful hiking trails, open spaces, and scenic views.\n These factors have fueled rapid population growth\u2014from 48,231 in 2010 to 81,415 in 2023\u2014including an 11.3% jump between 2020 and 2023 alone. For comparison, the national growth rate has averaged just 0.8% per year since 2000. As more people move to the area, demand continues to climb, driving housing costs upward.\n Delaware, Ohio  Understanding the Costs  Delaware\u2014the city in Ohio, not the state\u2014offers small-town charm, improving amenities, and easy access to Columbus, the state\u2019s capital. These advantages helped make Delaware County the second fastest-growing county in Ohio between 2020 and 2023. With more people moving in, housing demand has risen. Delaware County\u2019s median home value may be close to the national figure, but monthly housing costs average $1,790\u2014well above the U.S. median. Transportation is also costly, averaging $1,406 per month, over $300 more per month than the national average of $1,098. What Makes the City So Expensive?  Delaware\u2019s location just outside Columbus makes it attractive to those seeking a balance between suburban comfort and urban convenience.\n The city has also seen continued development in its retail, dining, and recreational amenities. These have only added to its appeal and pushed costs higher, making Delaware an increasingly expensive place to retire.\n Flagstaff, Arizona  Understanding the Costs  Flagstaff is another city where retirement doesn\u2019t come cheap. Its combination of natural beauty, outdoor recreation, and university-town charm contributes to a surprisingly high cost of living.\n Though monthly housing costs remain close to average in Flagstaff\u2019s Coconino County, the median home value is around $503,400, well above the national figure of $416,900. Transportation is also expensive, with monthly costs averaging $1,378.NoteCoconino County has a population of roughly 144,643 people and a median age of 32. What Makes the City So Expensive?  Flagstaff\u2019s strong tourism economy helps keep property demand high and makes it especially attractive to second-home buyers and short-term rental investors.\n Not only does it offer plenty of outdoor excitement in its own right, but people also frequently visit on their way to see the Grand Canyon or explore the red rocks of Sedona.\n Flagstaff\u2019s proximity to Northern Arizona University adds additional housing pressure in the rental market. Students, faculty, and staff compete for housing near campus, tightening supply and contributing to higher prices.\n Key West, Florida  Understanding the Costs  Key West is an island at the very tip of the Florida Keys, and its tropical lifestyle costs a pretty penny. The city\u2019s limited land, booming tourism economy, and stiff competition for real estate make it one of the country's most expensive places to retire.\n The median home value in Key West\u2019s Monroe County is $723,800, nearly twice the U.S. median of $416,900. Housing costs reflect that gap, averaging $1,800 per month, more than 30% higher than the national average. Median monthly food and transportation costs are also above average. What Makes the City So Expensive?  Key West\u2019s warm climate, waterfront views, and vibrant culture ensure its real estate is in high demand. The city is also a favorite for vacationers and second-home buyers, adding even more pressure to the local housing market.\n On top of that, Key West\u2019s housing supply is inherently constrained. Not only does the island have only 5.6 square miles of land area, but many properties are consistently occupied by short-term vacationers and tourists, rather than long-term residents. Moyock, North Carolina  Understanding the Costs  Located just south of the Virginia border, Moyock primarily serves as a bedroom community for nearby military bases and job hubs in the Hampton Roads metro area, such as those in Chesapeake and Norfolk.\n Despite home values falling below the national median, monthly housing costs around Moyock still average $1,466, higher than the national figure of $1,338. Transportation costs are even more expensive\u2014not just relative to the national average, but also in total\u2014costing roughly $1,523 per month compared to $1,098 across the U.S. What Makes the City So Expensive?  Moyock\u2019s proximity to military installations and regional employment centers keeps housing demand high in the area. Property values are relatively affordable, but competition among renters drives up monthly payments.\n The county\u2019s elevated household income of $91,548 also contributes to expenses. Households with higher earnings can support steeper prices, potentially propping up the cost of housing, goods, and services.\nWarningLimited access to health care may be a hidden cost. Currituck County, where Moyock is located, has only one hospital and 15 total medical establishments. Local retirees in need of services may face long travel times and low appointment availability. New York City, New York  Understanding the Costs  It should come as no surprise that life is expensive in the City That Never Sleeps. The median home value in New York City is $1.1 million, more than two and a half times the national median. Meanwhile, monthly housing costs average $2,225, nearly $900 above the U.S. median of $1,338. The average New Yorker also pays around $1,484 per month in taxes\u2014more than the average American spends on housing. While the city\u2019s walkability and public transit options help keep transportation costs down, monthly food costs average $1,027, almost 25% higher than the national average of $832. Health care is another costly category. In 2023, the average annual premium for employer-sponsored single coverage was $9,173 in the state of New York, about 12% higher than the national average of $8,182.ImportantHousing, health care, transportation, and food are the top four expense categories in the average retiree\u2019s budget, accounting for nearly 80% of spending. What Makes the City So Expensive?  New York City\u2019s appeal is legendary. As a global hub for finance, fashion, and entertainment, it draws people from every corner of the world. That constant influx, combined with the city\u2019s notoriously limited space, keeps housing prices sky-high.\n The city\u2019s taxes are also uncommonly heavy due to New Yorkers paying federal, state, and city income taxes. When you add in some of the country\u2019s highest property taxes and a relatively high sales tax rate, the result is one of the most burdensome tax loads in the U.S. Finally, New York\u2019s high wage floor\u2014reflected in its median household income of $104,553\u2014inflates expenses across the board.\n Rockwall, Texas  Understanding the Costs  Only a short drive from Dallas, Rockwall offers lakeside living, a lively music scene, and a small-town atmosphere, all with convenient access to big-city amenities. That compelling combination continues to attract new residents and drive demand.\n Despite having a median home value of just $386,000, monthly housing costs in Rockwall County average $2,054. That\u2019s more than one and a half times the national average. Transportation expenses also add to the surprisingly high cost of living, with locals paying roughly $1,422 per month\u2014over $300 more than the average American. What Makes the City So Expensive?  Rockwall\u2019s proximity to Dallas has made it an increasingly attractive choice for commuters, families, and retirees. As the Dallas-Fort Worth metro continues to grow, demand for housing and services in cities like Rockwall has surged.\n Texas\u2019s lack of a state income tax helps mitigate Rockwall\u2019s inflated expenses, but can\u2019t offset them completely. The town is still more affordable than Dallas proper for now, but its cost of living is likely to rise as more people are drawn to it.\n San Diego, California  Understanding the Costs  With its year-round sunshine, easy access to the ocean, and laid-back culture, San Diego has long been one of the most desirable places to live in the U.S. Unsurprisingly, the cost of living in America\u2019s Finest City reflects that.\n The median home value is $791,600, nearly double the national median. Monthly housing costs are similarly steep, with a median of roughly $2,275. That\u2019s more than $900 more than the national average\u2014even higher than the costs in New York. Health care spending makes up a smaller portion of the typical household budget in San Diego than the rest of the country, but other expenses are harder to avoid. Residents can expect to pay roughly $1,312 per month for transportation and $1,055 in taxes. What Makes the City So Expensive?  San Diego\u2019s idyllic climate and coastal location keep housing demand perpetually high, especially since buildable land is limited. The presence of multiple military bases and large universities only adds to that pressure, increasing the competition.\n To top it all off, San Diego\u2019s elevated wealth\u2014evidenced by its median annual income of $102,285\u2014further inflates the cost of products and services across the board.\n Seattle, Washington  Understanding the Costs  Seattle\u2019s booming tech sector has transformed the city into one of the most dynamic economic hubs in the U.S., but that success has a cost\u2014namely, its cost of living.\n With a median home value of $811,200, the typical Seattle property is now nearly twice as expensive as the national median. Monthly housing costs have followed suit, reaching a median of roughly $2,222 per month\u2014putting them on par with the notoriously expensive New York.\n What Makes the City So Expensive?  Seattle\u2019s tech-fueled economy\u2014anchored by giants like Amazon and Microsoft\u2014has pumped high-paying jobs into the area and driven the median household income to $122,148. However, it\u2019s also driven up housing prices, with the effect compounded by Seattle\u2019s limited space and restrictive zoning laws.\nImportantHealth care costs are also on the rise. Insurance premiums in the state have jumped by double digits over the last decade, driven by a combination of population growth and increased demand for services. Retirement Considerations  Finances are always critical when choosing a retirement destination, especially for those living on a fixed income. The cost of expenses like housing, health care, transportation, and taxes can significantly impact your long-term comfort and stability.\n Because of this, cities like Key West and San Diego may seem out of reach for budget-conscious retirees. However, they\u2019re in high demand for good reason, and there\u2019s more to retirement than stretching your dollars. It\u2019s also your time to enjoy the fruits of your life\u2019s work.\n Don\u2019t let cost be the only lens through which you look at potential retirement places. Instead, consider quality of life as much as cost of living. The right destination should fit your budget and reflect your unique priorities\u2014whether that\u2019s staying close to family, enjoying outdoor adventures, or immersing yourself in a vibrant local culture.\n The Bottom Line  Affordability is a key concern for retirees, and housing often plays the biggest role in determining overall cost of living. However, it\u2019s not the only expense to consider when choosing a retirement destination. Health care, transportation, food, and taxes also significantly impact your long-term budget.\n High-demand cities\u2014whether prized for their climate, scenery, culture, or access to amenities\u2014often have higher costs across the board, but that doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re off limits. Where you retire should be just as much about supporting a lifestyle as it is about managing expenses. Don\u2019t focus so much on day-to-day costs that you overlook less tangible ones, like isolation, inconvenience, or distance from what brings you joy.\n", "tags": ["www.investopedia.com", "most-expensive-cities-to-retire-in-11727164", "wwwinvestopediacom"]}

While revenues slightly decreased, net income for the quarter was $2.8 billion\u2014up from $1.5 billion in the first quarter last year. However, this significant increase is due to a net unrealized gain of $1.9 billion, accounted for in net other income. The company claims a 14% volume growth of sales, setting records for 10 of its brands while expanding its international presence and working to close an acquisition of Horizon Therapeutics.

Amgen's Recent Developments  Amgen acquired ChemoCentryx in Oct. 2022, a biotechnology company that developed treatments for autoimmune diseases, inflammatory conditions, and cancer. The company acquired $3.9 billion in assets in the acquisition. Amgen also continues to battle in court for rights to its products. In April 2023, the abbreviated new drug application (ANDA) patent litigation injuction against Sandoz and Zydus Pharmaceuticals was affirmed by the U.S. District Court. This injunction prevents Sandoz from manufacturing and selling generic versions of Otezla until February 2028. Other patent litigations have been filed and are pending in court\u2014Janssen Biotech has filed to prevent Amgen from registering a drug biosimilar to one it produces, and antitrust suits are filed against Amgen by Sensipar and Regeneron. Amgen is facing a class-action suit from Roofers Local No. 149 Pension Fund, in which the defendants argue they were intentionally misled about the potential tax liabilities of a decline in Amgen's stock value.Fast FactAmgen reported $26.3 billion in sales for the fiscal year 2022, an increase from FY 2021's $25.9 billion.What Does Amgen Produce?Amgen uses genetics to develop treatments for serious illnesses. Some examples of its products are ENBREL, Prolia, Otezla, and XGEVA.What Was Amgen's First Drug?Amgen's first drug was Epogen, created in 1983 by a team of scientists led by Fu-Kuen Lin.What Does Amgen Do?Amgen is a pharmaceutical company that uses advanced genetics to make biological medicines. The Bottom Line  Amgen and its development team have offered relief to many patients that are suffering. The company focuses its resources on alleviating physical pain.\n The company faces increasing competition from generic products and biosimilar treatments, but its existing and new products, Enbrel and Prolia, contributed to growth in 2022, although in the first quarter of 2023, Amgen experienced a 2.1 % decrease in total revenues year-over-year.\n The company expects total revenue in 2023 to end up between $26 billion and $27.3 billion and forecasts an earnings per share increase to between $17.60 and $18.70 (non-GAAP basis).", "tags": ["www.investopedia.com", "articles", "wwwinvestopediacom"]}
{"url": "https://www.investopedia.com/amgen-amgn-option-traders-unenthusiastic-into-earnings-5195434", "title": "Amgen (AMGN) Option Traders Unenthusiastic Into Earnings", "text": " Investors of Amgen Inc. (AMGN) have kept the share prices range bound ahead of the company's fiscal second quarter earnings announcement. At first glance, it appears that option traders are positioned for a negative move, as the number of put options are growing in the open interest. The unusual option activity could create a strong upward trend in the price action if Amgen delivers a positive earnings surprise.\n A growing number of put options remain in the open interest for AMGN, and option premiums are unusually high right now. Trading volumes indicate that traders have been selling calls and buying puts in anticipation of an unfavorable earnings report. Unwinding these bets could result in unexpected upward pressure on the share price of Amgen.\n Correctly predicting the direction a stock will move following earnings is difficult. However, a comparison between the stock's price action and option trading activity shows that, if AMGN delivers a positive report, the company's share price could rise significantly, moving closer to its 20-day moving average after the announcement. This is possible because options are priced for a move downwards, but unexpected good news could catch traders by surprise and create a rapid rise in share price.\nKey TakeawaysTraders and investors have kept Amgen's share price range bound headed into the earnings announcement.\u00a0The share price has been closing just below its 20-day moving average.Call and put pricing is predicting a stronger move to the downside.The volatility-based support and resistance levels allow for a slightly stronger move upwards.This setup creates an opportunity for traders to profit from an unexpected earnings outcome. By comparing the details of both stock price and option behavior, chart watchers can gain valuable insight, although it is imperative to understand the context in which this price behavior took place. The chart below depicts the price action for the AMGN share price as of Friday, July 30. This created the setup leading into the earnings announcement.\n Current Trends  The one-month trend of AMGN stock has the shares remaining in the middle of the volatility range before falling to rest just below the 20-day moving average. Over the past month, it's notable that the lowest AMGN share price was near $241 in late June, whereas the highest share price was nearly $250 in mid-July. The price closed in the middle region depicted by the technical studies on this chart.\n The studies are formed by 20-day Keltner Channel indicators. These depict price levels that represent a multiple of the Average True Range (ATR) for the stock. This array helps to highlight the way the price has fallen below the 20-day moving average in the week before earnings. This price move from Amgen shares implies that investors expect a negative earnings result.\nTipThe Average True Range (ATR) has become a standard tool for depicting historical volatility over time. The typical average length of time used in its calculation is 10 to 20 time periods, which includes two to four weeks of trading on a daily chart. In this context where the price trend for AMGN has remained in an average range, chart watchers can recognize that traders and investors are expressing ambivalence going into earnings. However, it is notable that, in the week before earnings, AMGN's share price fell from its monthly high, falling below the 20-day moving average a few days before the report. That makes it important for chart watchers to determine whether the move is reflecting investors' expectations for unfavorable earnings or not.\n Option trading details can provide additional context to assist chart watchers in forming an opinion about investor expectations. Recently, option traders are favoring puts over calls by a slim margin, yet the open interest on options has a slightly larger number of puts than calls. Normally, this volume suggests that investors are expecting a positive earnings report, but the recent option volumes speak otherwise, as recent order sentiment is bearish.\nTipThe Keltner Channel indicator displays a set of semi-parallel lines based on a 20-day simple moving average and an upper and lower line. Because the upper lines are drawn by adding a multiple of ATR to the average and the lower lines are drawn by subtracting a multiple of ATR from the average price, then this channel indicator makes for an excellent visualization tool when charting historical volatility. Trading Activity  Option traders recognize that Amgen shares are in an average range and have priced their options as a bet that the stock will close within one of the two boxes depicted in the chart between today and Aug. 6, the Friday after the earnings report is released. The green-framed box represents the pricing that call option sellers are offering. It implies a 37% chance that Amgen shares will close inside this range by the end of the week if prices go higher. The red box represented the pricing for put options with a 35% probability if prices go lower on the announcement.\n It's important to note that the open interest featured over 83,000 active call options compared to roughly 58,000 put options, demonstrating the bias that option buyers had, as the majority of the trades were call options. This amount normally implies that call option traders expect a rise in price; however, the past five days have shown rising put option volume and implied volatility falling for call options, which signifies that these options are being sold. Because the call box and put box are relatively equal in size, however, it tells us that the higher percentage of put options traded has only mildly skewed expectations lower. A far more complacent outlook is implied.\n The purple lines on the chart are generated by a 10-day Keltner Channel study set at four times the ATR. This measure tends to create highly correlated regions of strong support and resistance in the price action. These regions show up when the channel lines make a noticeable turn within the previous three months.\u00a0\n The levels that the turns mark are annotated in the chart below. What is notable in this chart is that the call and put pricing are in such a close range with plenty of space to run either downwards or upwards. This suggests that option buyers don't have a strong conviction about how the company will report, even though put volume is rising. Although investors and option traders do not expect it, a surprising report could push prices dramatically higher or lower.\n These support and resistance levels show a large range of support and resistance for prices. As a result, it is possible that any news, surprisingly bad or good, will catch investors by surprise and could generate an unusually large move. After the previous earnings announcement, AMGN shares fell by 7.2% the day of earnings before rising the following week. Investors may be expecting the same kind of move in the price after this announcement. With plenty of room in the volatility range, share prices could rise or fall more than expected.\n Market Impact  AMGN shares typically make mild moves after earnings, so the results likely won't have a direct impact on indexes. However, no matter what the report says, it will likely have a significant impact on stocks in the health care sector. A positive report could lift other stocks in the sector such as Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), Pfizer Inc. (PFE), or AbbVie Inc. (ABBV). It could also affect exchange traded funds (ETFs) such as State Street's Health Care Sector ETF (XLV) or Invesco's Dynamic Pharmaceuticals ETF (PJP).\nDo you have a news tip for Investopedia reporters?

{"url": "https://www.investopedia.com/articles/mortgages-real-estate/08/homeowners-associations-tips.asp", "title": "Homeowners Associations (HOAs) Explained: 5 Things to Know Before Buying", "text": " If you plan to buy a home in a planned community, condo building, or townhouse development, you\u2019ll probably need approval from a homeowners association (HOA). An HOA is a group that makes and enforces rules for the properties in its area. It also collects monthly fees to pay for the upkeep of the community and manages shared amenities such as a gym or a pool.\u00a0\n HOA communities can be appealing because they often have well-kept amenities and rules that help keep property values up. But they also involve regular fees and rules about what you can do with your property.\nKey TakeawaysHomeowners associations create and enforce rules for residential communities. Membership is often mandatory for all property owners within their jurisdiction.HOA fees can run over $800 monthly on top of your mortgage and other housing costs. These fees can fund amenities, maintenance, and reserve accounts for future repairs.CC&Rs (covenants, conditions, and restrictions) regulate everything from exterior appearance to pets.HOAs have many legal powers, including the ability to impose fines, place liens on properties, and, in some cases, initiate foreclosure proceedings.Before purchasing in an HOA community, consider reviewing its governing documents, financial statements, and other information to assess the association's health and compatibility with your lifestyle. 1. Impact of Homeowners Associations on Homeownership Homeowners associations can have a significant impact on almost every part of owning a home in their community. The extent of an HOA\u2019s influence varies between communities. Some associations maintain a light touch, focusing primarily on maintaining common areas and enforcing basic standards. Others control nearly all aspects of your property\u2019s appearance and usage. This variation makes it critical to research the association governing your potential new home before purchasing.\n 2. Homeowners Association Legal Powers\u00a0  An HOA\u2019s power comes from a legal document called the covenants, conditions, and restrictions (CC&Rs). These rules explain what homeowners can and cannot do with their property and how they must take care of it.\n A CC&R functions as a contractual obligation between you and your homeowners association. When you purchase property in an HOA community, you agree to follow these rules. The CC&Rs are filed with your county recorder's office and remain in effect even if a particular property\u2019s ownership changes. Common restrictions found in CC&Rs include:\nProperty appearance: Regulations on paint colors, architectural styles, landscaping requirements, and decorative elementsStructural modifications: Rules governing additions, renovations, fencing, and exterior alterationsVehicle restrictions: Limitations on the number, type, and parking locations of vehiclesPet policies: Rules about the number, size, breed, and containment of animalsUsage restrictions: Regulations on home businesses, short-term rentals, and non-residential activitiesNuisance prevention: Rules regarding noise, odors, visible storage, and other potential disruptionsSignage limits: Restrictions on political signs, advertisements, and other displays 3. Homeowners Association Costs  If you own a home in an HOA community, you\u2019ll have to pay an HOA fee in addition to your regular mortgage and home insurance costs. The fee is usually paid monthly or quarterly.\u00a0\n HOA costs can vary widely depending on where you live, from a high of $859 a month in New York to a low of $64 a month in Idaho. These fees typically cover:\nMaintenance of common areas and landscapingUpkeep of shared amenities (pools, fitness centers, clubhouses)Insurance for common propertyUtilities for shared facilitiesOperational costs and management fees Beyond regular dues, HOAs can also impose special assessments\u2014one-time charges to cover unexpected expenses or major projects when reserve funds are insufficient.\u00a0\n When determining your loan eligibility and amount, your mortgage lender will factor HOA fees into your debt-to-income calculations.\u00a0\n 4. Homeowners Association Governance  If you decide to buy a home in an HOA community, it\u2019s helpful to learn how the HOA works. This could make it easier for you to deal with the HOA and protect your rights as a homeowner.\u00a0\n Most associations operate through a tiered governance structure that includes general membership (all homeowners), an elected board of directors, and, potentially, professional management. The board typically consists of volunteer homeowners whom community members elect to make operational decisions, enforce rules, manage finances, and maintain community standards.\u00a0\n The primary governing documents, beyond the CC&Rs, are the HOA bylaws, which establish:\nBoard composition and election proceduresMeeting requirements and voting protocolsPowers and limitations of the boardCommittee structures and responsibilitiesAmendment processes for governing documentsDispute resolution procedures As a homeowner in an HOA community, you typically have the right to:\nAttend and participate in meetingsVote in board electionsReview association financial recordsPropose changes to rules and regulationsRun for board positions 5. Homeowners Association Finances  Before deciding to buy a home in an HOA community, it\u2019s a good idea to check the HOA\u2019s finances and how well it\u2019s currently managed. This can help you avoid unexpected costs and determine if the HOA is running properly.\n Request and carefully review key financial information, including:\nCurrent balance sheet showing assets, liabilities, and reserve fundsAnnual budget with income and expense projectionsAny studies indicating anticipated future capital expensesHistory of special assessments over the yearsDelinquency rates among current homeownersRecent audit reports or financial reviewsMeeting minutes discussing financial decisionsPending litigation against the HOA Additionally, consider speaking with current residents of an HOA about their own experiences. Ask specifically about the HOA\u2019s fee history, communication regarding financial decisions, and transparency in the budgeting process.\n Homeowners Association Pros  Advantages of HOA communities include:\nMaintained amenities: Many HOAs provide access to pools, fitness centers, parks, clubhouses, tennis courts, and other facilities that would be unaffordable for individual homeowners.Property value protection: Houses in HOAs are 6% more valuable than similar homes located outside of HOAs, according to the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank.\u00a0Reduced maintenance responsibilities: Particularly in condominiums and townhouses, HOAs often handle exterior maintenance, landscaping, and occasionally utilities, potentially reducing your workload and time commitment as a homeowner. Homeowners Association Cons  Disadvantages of HOA living include:\nFinancial obligations: Monthly dues, potential special assessments, and fines for violating the CC&Rs represent additional costs beyond your mortgage, taxes, and insurance. These expenses can strain budgets, particularly when unexpected assessments arise.\u00a0Restrictions on property use: Rules regarding exterior appearance and renovations can limit your freedom as a homeowner, and breaking these restrictions could lead to fines.Governance challenges: Volunteer boards sometimes lack management expertise, leading to ineffective operations or internal politics within the HOA.\u00a0Foreclosure risk: In many states, HOAs can foreclose on your property for unpaid dues or fines, sometimes even when the amount you owe is relatively insignificant compared to your property\u2019s value. The Bottom Line  Homeowners associations create organized living spaces with appealing amenities, helping protect property values. In return, homeowners must pay fees and follow community rules.

Headquartered in Boston, Fidelity\u2019s storied history began in 1946. As of Dec. 31, 2024, the company had 39.2 million client accounts holding $5.9 trillion in discretionary assets, and ranked among the top brokerage firms in terms of assets under management. Investopedia began evaluating online brokerages in 2019, and Fidelity has shown a commitment to improving its financial products and services ever since. Improvements in financial advisor support, bond liquidity analysis, and the new Fidelity Youth app were the highlights of our 2024 product demonstration with the company. But the enhancements didn't stop there: Fidelity also revamped its process for opening core brokerage accounts, further streamlining the online experience for new users. The accounts now also have a comprehensive cash management product that is jam-packed with banking features.\u00a0\n Fidelity has long been an industry leader when it comes to lowering fees, but is also widely-regarded for its huge customer service network, which includes 216 customer centers, and provides excellent client support for its low-cost, high-value offering. Investors looking for an online broker that keeps costs low, all while delivering some of the most powerful tools in the industry and resisting the common industry practice of collecting PFOF, will be hard-pressed to find a better broker than Fidelity.ACTUAL USER EXPERIENCE \"I moved all of our family\u2019s investment accounts to Fidelity in 2021 for one simple, but valuable, reason: It\u2019s the only brokerage firm that offers every single account type we have, allowing me to house all of our investments under the same roof. We have a lot of different account types\u2014from various retirement and taxable accounts, to an inherited IRA, to 529s and custodial accounts, and even an investable HSA. Before consolidating to Fidelity, I had to log into multiple places to check on our various investments. Now, except for a new workplace 401(k), I have one login that shows me everything on a single screen. And when I need customer support, Fidelity advisors can also view things as a whole. Moving to Fidelity has added a lot of ease and efficiency to my financial life.\" - Sabrina Karl, Staff Writer for InvestopediaEditor's NoteIn addition to our review of Fidelity's online brokerage platform, we've also reviewed the company's robo-advisor service, Fidelity Go. Charles Schwab: Best for Beginners 4.7Open an AccountAccount Minimum: $0\nFees: $0 for stock/ETF trades, $0.65 per contract for options\nRead full reviewOpen an Account Why We Chose It  Even before TD Ameritrade\u2019s educational content was incorporated into its ecosystem, Charles Schwab\u2014which acquired TD Ameritrade in 2020\u2014was known as one of the best platforms for new traders and investors. With the integration now complete, Schwab has taken over top ranks in this category, a position TD Ameritrade used to dominate. Schwab now houses the most comprehensive library of evergreen learning materials, along with seemingly endless coaching programs and regularly scheduled live training events, making it the best for beginner investors.

Charles Schwab has since grown into a household name in the brokerage industry and, in October 2020 completed its acquisition of TD Ameritrade, with full client integration finalized by mid-2024. Not only does Schwab provide the right mix of usability, tools, education, and research to its diverse customer base, but it does so across multiple top-tier platforms. As of end of February 2025, Schwab\u2019s total client assets stood at $10.28 trillion. With Schwab\u2019s integration of TD Ameritrade complete, the combination of Schwab\u2019s exceptional lineup of products and services and TD Ameritrade\u2019s powerful trading capabilities has boosted the company even closer to the top of our comprehensive rating model. One of the most anticipated additions to Schwab's lineup occurred on April 11, 2024, with the company announcing that futures and forex trading, along with a new Portfolio Margin feature, have been made available on its thinkorswim platform. Then, on Oct. 30, 2024, the company announced even more exciting news when it introduced overnight trading in S&P 500 and Nasdaq-100-traded stocks, as well as hundreds of additional exchange-traded funds (ETFs), 24 hours a day, five days a week (24/5). On Feb. 12, 2025, the company made overnight trading available to all clients via the thinkorswim platform. Prospective customers should note, however, that crypto spot trading still isn\u2019t available, but spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs are offered.\nEditor's NoteIn addition to our review of Charles Schwab\u2019s online brokerage platform, we also reviewed the company's robo-advisor service, Schwab Intelligent Portfolios.

Eventually, Interactive Brokers Inc. was incorporated as a U.S. broker-dealer in 1993, and the company has since developed into one of the industry\u2019s most complete online brokerage platforms. Interactive Brokers (IBKR) offers astonishing access to 160 markets in 34 countries and support for its services in 200 countries and territories, all with funding and trading capabilities in up to 28 currencies.

One of the first adopters of technology to the financial markets, both algorithmic and active traders have long regarded the company highly for its advanced trading features, highly customizable tools, low margin rates, and alpha-generating capabilities. Investopedia's team of industry experts is constantly delighted by IBKR\u2019s innovative enhancements that just make so much sense from a purist\u2019s perspective. IBKR\u2019s latest product innovation is IBKR Desktop, a next-generation platform that combines a simple user interface with many of the company\u2019s powerful trading solutions. It features innovations like Option Lattice, a graphical options chain display highlighting potential outliers in key metrics, and MultiSort, which enables users to sort data using multiple factors simultaneously.Always looking for ways to use latest technology to give clients an advantage, the company also recently launched AI-powered news summaries. This idea of simplicity is really where things have been getting interesting for Interactive Brokers, as the company has committed to making its platforms more accessible to beginners. With notable touches like the expansion of educational content across several platforms, including its entry-level IBKR Lite platform; available fractional investing; and the innovative and helpful Options Wizard tool offered on its user-friendly Global Trader mobile app (as well as other platforms), Interactive Brokers is quickly gaining ground on the industry\u2019s top all-around brokerage platforms.\nEditor's Note:In addition to our review of Interactive Brokers' online brokerage platform, we've also reviewed the company's robo-advisor service, Interactive Advisors. tastytrade: Best Broker for Options 4.1Open an AccountAccountMinimum: $0\nFees & Commissions: $0 stock trades, $1 to open options trades (capped at $10 per leg), $0 to close\nRead full reviewOpen an Account Why We Chose It  For the fourth year in a row, we chose tastytrade as the best options trading platform because of its industry-leading options pricing structure, which includes pricing caps that make it the lowest-cost brokerage for high-volume, high-frequency option traders.

But with the right guidance, the many options strategies that are available to use can become powerful weapons that allow both traders and investors to benefit from key factors like time decay and leverage. Created by the same people who developed TD Ameritrade\u2019s highly regarded thinkorswim platform, tastytrade maintains its stance as the best broker for options because of its intuitive delivery of an industry-best mix of comprehensive options-focused tools and content.\u00a0\n Launched as tastyworks in 2017 and headquartered in Chicago, tastytrade delivers very competitive fees for options trading, including standout commission caps for large lot sizes, as well as the absence of any fees when closing positions.

Following Morgan Stanley\u2019s acquisition of E*TRADE in 2020, the company has only continued to advance its capabilities by integrating many of Morgan Stanley\u2019s highly regarded research materials, thought leadership insights, and large pool of financial advisors.\u00a0\u00a0\n As one of the largest online brokers in the country, E*TRADE brings an expansive list of investment choices and trading tools to clients via its website, desktop, and two mobile platforms.

For more experienced investors, the ability to do deep analysis has never been greater than now, when proprietary Morgan Stanley research joins highly regarded third-party research and consensus ratings.

Since then, the company has gone on to introduce options and futures trading, has made solid cash management and IRA matching services available to its Robinhood Gold members, rolled out its more advanced Legend trading platform, and as recently as March 26, 2025, launched a wealth management product known as Robinhood Strategies, along with a number of additional products the company plans to roll out later this year. Along the way, Robinhood has also introduced cryptocurrency trading to its customers, and has continued to build its list of tradable crypto ever since. U.S.-based crypto enthusiasts who appreciate Robinhood for its easy-to-use trading platforms will enjoy selecting from the company's list of 26 supported crypto assets, the brokerage industry's largest. For more advanced traders, however, Robinhood still lacks access to some of the critical research and sophisticated trading tools that some larger industry competitors offer. In addition, commission-free crypto trades still come with spread charges, and roughly half of the cryptocurrencies that Robinhood supports are not tradable through the new Legend platform.The Bottom LineThrough our exhaustive research, we found that Fidelity not only outshines the competition when it comes to ETF investing, low costs, and cash management features, but it is also the best online brokerage platform overall. While International Brokers\u2019 ongoing evolution into a more beginner-friendly platform is driving it closer to parity with the industry\u2019s top all-around brokerage platforms, it remains a top choice for advanced trading techniques and risk management, as well as international trading.For traders planning to make options the main strategy they use to reach their investment goals, tastytrade\u2019s platform and market content are hard to beat. Charles Schwab\u2019s integration of TD Ameritrade's educational programs and trading personalities has produced an unparalleled body of actionable learning materials and live training content for beginners.E*TRADE\u2019s long history of enhancing the user experience continues to shine through with its fantastic mobile apps, while Robinhood makes crypto trading fun and easy for crypto enthusiasts.

Why You Should Trust Us  Investopedia collected 89 criteria that are critical to investors, from 27 online brokerage companies. We used this data to review each brokerage platform for fees, usability, research amenities, and other key features to provide unbiased, comprehensive reviews to ensure our readers make the right decision for their investing needs. Investopedia launched in 1999, and has been helping readers find the best online brokerage accounts since 2019. How to Choose a Brokerage Account  Investors choosing an online broker will find a wide range of options, each with varying product offerings, cost structures, and features. The best broker for you will ultimately depend on your individual goals, priorities, and preferences. Some investors may require advanced platforms with access to niche markets and exotic instruments, while others happily settle for a simple, user-friendly mobile app and cost-effective pricing. Whatever your objectives, here are some key factors to consider when choosing an online broker. Commissions and fees  The commissions and fees your broker charges directly impact your bottom line, and can be a major factor to consider, especially for active traders. Nowadays, with rare exceptions, online brokers offer commission-free stock, ETF, and mutual funds trading, but still charge for options trades. In addition, brokers also generally charge for trading more advanced instruments, like futures, and more exotic asset classes, like cryptocurrencies.\n Available assets and instruments  The breadth of assets and instruments available to trade determines how flexible your investment portfolio or trading strategies can be. Most online brokers offer trading in stocks, ETFs, and options. A sizable number also provides access to futures and mutual funds. A small, but steadily growing group allows clients to trade cryptocurrencies.\u00a0\n Additionally, some brokers now offer fractional shares, which allow investors to buy a portion of high-priced stocks. This feature can be especially helpful for those with smaller accounts, as it makes expensive stocks more accessible. Access to a specific asset class can be a deciding factor when choosing an online broker.\n Your own investing or trading style  Different brokers cater to different trading styles. Whether you manage a long-term stock portfolio, trade complex options strategies, or actively scalp intraday, make sure the platforms and features offered by your broker complement your style and facilitate your trades.\n User experience  A well-designed, intuitive platform can make trading easier and more enjoyable for traders of all levels, but especially for beginners. In recent years, many online brokers have invested significant time and money into making the user experience as seamless as possible.\u00a0Advanced platforms, although improving, may still come with a learning curve due to the amount of instruments and the complexity of tools on offer.\n Research tools  Research tools help investors make better trade decisions. Among others, this may include access to market data, analyst ratings, charting tools, and latest financial reports. Brokers with robust research capabilities may provide traders an edge by offering quicker access to essential market data.\n Educational content  For beginners and experienced investors alike, educational resources are a way to continue improving their knowledge and strategies. A broker offering tutorials, webinars, and in-depth guides can help users stay informed and grow their trading expertise.\n Other key features  Other considerations may include account minimums and benefits, supported order types, customer support accessibility, and premium account offerings.\u00a0Brokers with zero account minimums are more accessible to new investors, while traders with large account balances may benefit from earning interest on unused cash.\u00a0\n Active traders will value a broker\u2019s support of complex order types, and those who trade international markets or cryptocurrencies will appreciate the ability to get customer support 24/7. More recently, some brokers also began offering premium accounts - providing additional services or offering better pricing, usually in exchange for a monthly fee. Such accounts may be beneficial to certain investors.\nFinancial Advisor Insight\"When you're thinking about opening a brokerage or investment account, it\u2019s good to start by considering your goals and how hands-on you want to be,\" said Taylor Kovar, CFP, MBA, a member of\u00a0Investopedia\u2019s Financial Advisor Council. \"Are you looking to invest for something long-term, like retirement or a big purchase, or are you focusing on shorter-term goals? And don\u2019t feel like you have to go all in right away\u2014you can always start small and gradually increase your contributions as you get more comfortable.\" What Is the Difference Between a Full-Service Broker and an Online Broker?  This report identifies the best online brokers and trading platforms. It is natural to ask, \u201cHow do these brokers and platforms differ from full-service brokers?\u201d One key difference is that online brokers cater to do-it-yourself (DIY) investors. In contrast, full-service brokers aim to relieve you of as much heavy financial lifting as possible by shifting it to their own advisors or affiliated experts.\n While online brokers harp on their low costs\u2013not just for trades but also low minimums to open accounts and low costs for access to research, tools, and services\u2013full-service brokers boast of the wide range of their offerings. Those include everything from personal financial planning to insurance, estate planning, retirement planning, accounting services, tax advice, and more.\n Still, the boundary between the two categories of brokers is more and more blurry. Online brokers increasingly offer more services, while full-service brokers increasingly cut costs. In fact, many investors would be hard pressed to explain why some online brokers\u2013especially the larger ones\u2013should not be thought of as full-service firms.\u00a0\nFinancial Advisor InsightCertified financial planner Michael Donnelly, who is account director of corporate relations at the CFP Board of Standards, said, \u201cThe financial services landscape has dramatically changed over the past 30 years. Firms that once served specific clients now compete to keep pace with broader client needs and lower-cost competitors. [Full]-service and online brokers have had to expand their offerings and cut costs to stay competitive. As a result, investors benefit from more similar and competitively priced products across the financial planning ecosystem.\u201d Frequently Asked Questions What Is an Online Brokerage Account and How Does it Work?A brokerage account is a type of account similar in function to the accounts you have with a bank. With a brokerage account, you deposit funds with an investment firm (the brokerage). This is usually done by a transfer from your existing bank account. Once funds are added to your brokerage account, you can put the money to work using the brokerage's trading platform to invest those funds in the market. The assets you buy with your cash can be anything offered by that brokerage, including stocks, bonds, ETFs, and even cryptocurrency.Your online brokerage account will display your holdings (the assets you've purchased) as well as your cash balance (your buying power). If you invest in something that gains in value, you can sell it and the profits will be deposited in your online brokerage account. From there, you can place another trade or even transfer the funds out to your regular bank account to use elsewhere. Some brokerage accounts even allow you to earn interest on your uninvested cash.How Much Money Do you Need to Open a Brokerage Account?There is no longer a real minimum to start investing in the financial markets. With many brokers offering margin accounts with access to fractional shares and no required minimums, you can open and fund an account with any amount of money. If you don't have a lot of money to invest, however, it will influence how you approach the market. Although you could invest $1 in fractional shares of a specific stock, the better approach with limited capital is to use ETFs. Index tracking ETFs, for example, offer greater diversification for your dollar than a single company stock because every share (and fractional share) of the ETF replicates an index made up of many companies in many different industries. You could also consider using options to leverage your dollars with a directional bet on the market or a specific stock, but this is a strategy best reserved for risk capital\u2014not the whole of your limited investment capital.When investing with small sums, consistency is the key to building wealth. If you can regularly put a set amount of money into the market\u2014even $10 a week\u2014you will be surprised at how quickly it begins to grow. This consistency also helps to smooth market effects, as you will be buying dips and peaks as the market goes up and down.Can You Invest With a Small Amount of Money?Many online brokers allow for small minimum deposits which can be a great alternative for those with limited funds. Account minimums (if any) are displayed at the top of our reviews, as well as in our selection of the best platforms for different types of investors. If you are looking for more general guidance on investing with limited capital, check out our article on smart investing on a small budget.Do Brokers Offer Mobile Platforms?Some online brokers have powerful mobile apps delivering nearly all the features that their desktop counterparts do. For example, E*TRADE's app, which we picked as our best app for mobile investing and trading, offers two mobile platforms that are streamlined versions of the company's powerful desktop platform.Can You Lose Money in a Brokerage Account?Yes, you can. It is a reality of the market that no reward comes without risk. You can lose money buying a bad investment, but you can also lose by buying a good investment at the wrong time. Investment decisions should be guided by extensive research and careful consideration of your risk tolerance. When it comes to the financial markets, there are endless possibilities for making and losing money. Unless all the funds in your brokerage account are sitting in uninvested cash (brokerage cash accounts are afforded up to $250,000 of protection by Securities Investor Protection Corporation insurance), there is a risk you will lose money.Another way of looking at that, however, is that a brokerage account sitting full of uninvested cash isn't at risk of making any money either. You can use strategies like asset allocation and diversification to reduce the risk of you losing money, but you will never fully eliminate it without also eliminating your chances of making a decent return.Can I Buy Stocks Without a Broker?Yes, you can actually buy and sell stocks without a broker, but it is not a common approach these days. Some companies still offer direct stock purchase plans that allow you to buy shares directly from the company. Companies administer these plans according to internal rules, and some are only open to company employees. You need to contact companies to find out whether they offer a direct stock purchase plan and what the terms and conditions are. These plans initially helped investors avoid brokerage fees, but the rise of online discount brokers with zero fees has removed this barrier, making the direct stock purchase plan somewhat of a relic.What Is the Difference Between Investing and Trading?An important thing to consider is the distinction between investing and trading. When people talk about investing they generally mean buying assets to hold long-term. The goal of investing is to gradually build wealth and reach your retirement goals. Conversely, trading involves short-term strategies that maximize returns on a short-term basis, such as daily or monthly. Trading is generally considered riskier than investing.All these factors are worth considering before choosing an online broker. Do you want to trade or invest?

Fidelity is a repeat winner in this category, having earned the top spot from Charles Schwab in 2023. Best for Low Costs  Fidelity has long been an industry leader when it comes to lowering fees, and its transparent and compelling fee schedule is the reason why\u2014for the fourth year running\u2014it wins for low costs.\n Best for Cash Management  Finding the best brokerage account for cash management is not just about earning the highest interest rate possible. It\u2019s also about seamless integration with essential, no-fee banking features and industry-leading insurance. In these areas, Fidelity\u2019s cash management offering is unmatched, and it comes with solid passive earnings power on uninvested cash, along with reimbursable access to a global network of ATMs.\n Pros & Cons ProsNo payment for order flow (PFOF) makes for excellent order executionStrong portfolio analysis and account featuresSuperior trading platforms for all types of investorsTop-tier educational content, screening tools, and research capabilitiesFDIC insurance up to $5 million on uninvested cashConsOnly three digital coins available for tradingMinimum balance required for some index tradingMultiple platforms may be required to access all tools Overview  In an industry full of innovative companies competing for the attention of an incredibly diverse universe of traders and investors, Fidelity delivers the most well-rounded product offering to suit the needs of nearly every investor. Headquartered in Boston, Fidelity\u2019s storied history began in 1946. As of Dec. 31, 2024, the company had 39.2 million client accounts holding $5.9 trillion in discretionary assets, and ranked among the top brokerage firms in terms of assets under management. Investopedia began evaluating online brokerages in 2019, and Fidelity has shown a commitment to improving its financial products and services ever since. Improvements in financial advisor support, bond liquidity analysis, and the new Fidelity Youth app were the highlights of our 2024 product demonstration with the company. But the enhancements didn't stop there: Fidelity also revamped its process for opening core brokerage accounts, further streamlining the online experience for new users. The accounts now also have a comprehensive cash management product that is jam-packed with banking features.\u00a0\n Fidelity has long been an industry leader when it comes to lowering fees, but is also widely-regarded for its huge customer service network, which includes 216 customer centers, and provides excellent client support for its low-cost, high-value offering. Investors looking for an online broker that keeps trading costs low, all while delivering some of the most powerful tools in the industry and resisting the common industry practice of collecting PFOF, will be hard-pressed to find a better broker than Fidelity.ACTUAL USER EXPERIENCE \"I moved all of our family\u2019s investment accounts to Fidelity in 2021 for one simple, but valuable, reason: It\u2019s the only brokerage firm that offers every single account type we have, allowing me to house all of our investments under the same roof. We have a lot of different account types\u2014from various retirement and taxable accounts, to an inherited IRA, to 529s and custodial accounts, and even an investable HSA. Before consolidating to Fidelity, I had to log into multiple places to check on our various investments. Now, except for a new workplace 401(k), I have one login that shows me everything on a single screen. And when I need customer support, Fidelity advisors can also view things as a whole. Moving to Fidelity has added a lot of ease and efficiency to my financial life.\" - Sabrina Karl, Staff Writer for InvestopediaEditor's NoteIn addition to our review of Fidelity's online brokerage platform, we've also reviewed the company's robo-advisor service, Fidelity Go. Charles Schwab: Best for Beginners 4.7Open an AccountAccount Minimum: $0\nFees: $0 for stock/ETF trades, $0.65 per contract for options\nRead full reviewOpen an Account Why We Chose It  Even before TD Ameritrade\u2019s educational content was incorporated into its ecosystem, Charles Schwab\u2014which acquired TD Ameritrade in 2020\u2014was known as one of the best platforms for new traders and investors. With the integration now complete, Schwab has taken over top ranks in this category, a position TD Ameritrade used to dominate. Schwab now houses the most comprehensive library of evergreen learning materials, along with seemingly endless coaching programs and regularly scheduled live training events, making it the best for beginner investors. Pros & Cons ProsIndustry-leading educational contentMultiple user-friendly platforms\u00a0Superb ETF research and scannersOver 420 branches in 48 states\u00a0Access to the highly regarded thinkorswim\u00ae platformConsRelatively high margin ratesLow interest earned on uninvested cashLacks fractional ETF tradingNo direct investments in cryptocurrencies Overview  Chuck Schwab and his partners formed First Commander Corporation in April 1971, and later changed the company\u2019s name to Charles Schwab & Co., Inc. in 1973. Charles Schwab has since grown into a household name in the brokerage industry and, in October 2020 completed its acquisition of TD Ameritrade, with full client integration finalized by mid-2024. Not only does Schwab provide the right mix of usability, tools, education, and research to its diverse customer base, but it does so across multiple top-tier platforms. As of end of February 2025, Schwab\u2019s total client assets stood at $10.28 trillion. With Schwab\u2019s integration of TD Ameritrade complete, the combination of Schwab\u2019s exceptional lineup of products and services and TD Ameritrade\u2019s powerful trading capabilities has boosted the company even closer to the top of our comprehensive rating model. One of the most anticipated additions to Schwab's lineup occurred on April 11, 2024, with the company announcing that futures and forex trading, along with a new Portfolio Margin feature, have been made available on its thinkorswim platform. Then, on Oct. 30, 2024, the company announced even more exciting news when it introduced overnight trading in S&P 500 and Nasdaq-100-traded stocks, as well as hundreds of additional exchange-traded funds (ETFs), 24 hours a day, five days a week (24/5). On Feb. 12, 2025, the company made overnight trading available to all clients via the thinkorswim platform. Prospective customers should note, however, that crypto spot trading still isn\u2019t available, but spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs are offered.\nEditor's NoteIn addition to our review of Charles Schwab\u2019s online brokerage platform, we also reviewed the company's robo-advisor service, Schwab Intelligent Portfolios.

Ongoing enhancements to legacy platforms like the masterfully constructed Trader Workstation (TWS) and the February 2024 addition of the next-generation IBKR desktop offer just a small glimpse into how Interactive Brokers equips advanced traders to capitalize on fundamental dislocations and pricing inefficiencies better than any other platform we reviewed. This is the fourth straight year Interactive Brokers has earned this award.\n Best for International Trading  Simply put, not one of the 27 online brokerage companies we reviewed comes close to offering the scope of global research capabilities, international trading and support access, and currency-based funding variety that Interactive Brokers offers. That's why, for the fourth straight year, the company is our top broker for international traders. Best for Algorithmic Trading  As trading technology continues to advance, so too does the interest in algorithmic trading. Advanced traders will find a powerful lineup of algorithmic trading features in Interactive Brokers\u2019 pre-built algos, a laundry list of API languages, available algorithmic paper trading accounts, and so much more.

Customers can access these new tokens on the same platform they use for trading stocks, options, futures, currencies, bonds, mutual funds, and more, across 160+ global markets.

Eventually, Interactive Brokers Inc. was incorporated as a U.S. broker-dealer in 1993, and the company has since developed into one of the industry\u2019s most complete online brokerage platforms. Interactive Brokers (IBKR) offers astonishing access to 160 markets in 34 countries and support for its services in 200 countries and territories, all with funding and trading capabilities in up to 28 currencies. Simply put, this is by far the broadest global coverage in the industry. \u00a0As of March 2025, IBKR held just over $573B in client assets. One of the first adopters of technology to the financial markets, both algorithmic and active traders have long regarded the company highly for its advanced trading features, highly customizable tools, low margin rates, and alpha-generating capabilities. Investopedia's team of industry experts is constantly delighted by IBKR\u2019s innovative enhancements that just make so much sense from a purist\u2019s perspective. IBKR\u2019s latest product innovation is IBKR Desktop, a next-generation platform that combines a simple user interface with many of the company\u2019s powerful trading solutions. It features innovations like Option Lattice, a graphical options chain display highlighting potential outliers in key metrics, and MultiSort, which enables users to sort data using multiple factors simultaneously.Always looking for ways to use latest technology to give clients an advantage, the company also recently launched AI-powered news summaries. This idea of simplicity is really where things have been getting interesting for Interactive Brokers, as the company has committed to making its platforms more accessible to beginners. With notable touches like the expansion of educational content across several platforms, including its entry-level IBKR Lite platform; available fractional investing; and the innovative and helpful Options Wizard tool offered on its user-friendly Global Trader mobile app (as well as other platforms), Interactive Brokers is quickly gaining ground on the industry\u2019s top all-around brokerage platforms.\nEditor's Note:In addition to our review of Interactive Brokers' online brokerage platform, we've also reviewed the company's robo-advisor service, Interactive Advisors. tastytrade: Best Broker for Options 4.1Open an AccountAccountMinimum: $0\nFees & Commissions: $0 stock trades, $1 to open options trades (capped at $10 per leg), $0 to close\nRead full reviewOpen an Account Why We Chose It  For the fourth year in a row, we chose tastytrade as the best options trading platform because of its industry-leading options pricing structure, which includes pricing caps that make it the lowest-cost brokerage for high-volume, high-frequency option traders. In addition, tastytrade optimizes tools and content to specifically suit the needs of its options-focused client base.\n Pros & Cons ProsCapped commission structure for optionsHighly regarded tools for analyzing and monitoring options tradesFantastic options-specific content and educational materialFully customizable trading experienceFollow Feed feature allows users to follow trades of tastylive contributorsConsNo on-platform paper trading supportFew investing and retirement resourcesLacks some key investment choices like mutual funds Overview  Ask any options trader and they are likely to tell you that this form of derivative trading is complex and difficult to master. But with the right guidance, the many options strategies that are available to use can become powerful weapons that allow both traders and investors to benefit from key factors like time decay and leverage. Created by the same people who developed TD Ameritrade\u2019s highly regarded thinkorswim platform, tastytrade maintains its stance as the best broker for options because of its intuitive delivery of an industry-best mix of comprehensive options-focused tools and content.\u00a0\n Launched as tastyworks in 2017 and headquartered in Chicago, tastytrade delivers very competitive transaction fees for options trading, including standout commission caps for large lot sizes, as well as the absence of any fees when closing positions.

Following Morgan Stanley\u2019s acquisition of E*TRADE in 2020, the company has only continued to advance its capabilities by integrating many of Morgan Stanley\u2019s highly regarded research materials, thought leadership insights, and large pool of financial advisors.\u00a0\u00a0\n As one of the largest online brokers in the country, E*TRADE brings an expansive list of investment choices and trading tools to clients via its website, desktop, and two mobile platforms. E*TRADE\u2019s already vast educational catalog has only grown with the Morgan Stanley integration, complementing the intuitive site design in a way that lets new investors enter the market with confidence. For more experienced investors, the ability to do deep analysis has never been greater than now, when proprietary Morgan Stanley research joins highly regarded third-party research and consensus ratings. While E*TRADE only offers these more advanced traders exposure to cryptocurrencies via Spot Bitcoin & Ethereum ETFs and related stocks, traders have access to a wide array of analysis tools, charting functionality, and trading technology to make the most informed decisions in this and many other asset classes.\u00a0\nEditor's noteIn addition to our review of E*TRADE\u2019s online brokerage platform, we also reviewed the company's robo-advisor service, E*TRADE Core Portfolios. Robinhood: Best for Cryptocurrency Trading 3Open an AccountAccount Minimum: $0\nFees: $0 commissions for stock, ETF, options, and cryptocurrency trading, $0.50-$0.75 per futures contract\nRead full reviewOpen an Account Why We Chose It  Robinhood is Investopedia's choice as the best traditional broker for trading cryptocurrency because of its industry-leading selection of available digital assets and sleek, user-friendly platform.\n Pros & Cons ProsSimple, intuitive trading experience$0 trading commissionsBrokerage industry's largest selection of supported crypto assetsSolid cash management featuresAvailable IRA matchConsLack of full transparency around crypto spread pricingLimited researchLimited account typesNot all crypto assets are tradable through Robinhood Legend Overview  Robinhood, founded in 2013 and headquartered in Menlo Park, California, began as a simple, bare-bones mobile-focused platform determined to disrupting the brokerage industry with no-commission trading on stocks and ETFs. Since then, the company has gone on to introduce options and futures trading, has made solid cash management and IRA matching services available to its Robinhood Gold members, rolled out its more advanced Legend trading platform, and as recently as March 26, 2025, launched a wealth management product known as Robinhood Strategies, along with a number of additional products the company plans to roll out later this year. Along the way, Robinhood has also introduced cryptocurrency trading to its customers, and has continued to build its list of tradable crypto ever since. U.S.-based crypto enthusiasts who appreciate Robinhood for its easy-to-use trading platforms will enjoy selecting from the company's list of 26 supported crypto assets, the brokerage industry's largest. For more advanced traders, however, Robinhood still lacks access to some of the critical research and sophisticated trading tools that some larger industry competitors offer. In addition, commission-free crypto trades still come with spread charges, and roughly half of the cryptocurrencies that Robinhood supports are not tradable through the new Legend platform.\nThe Bottom LineThrough our exhaustive research, we found that Fidelity not only outshines the competition when it comes to ETF investing, low costs, and cash management features, but it is also the best online brokerage platform overall. While International Brokers\u2019 ongoing evolution into a more beginner-friendly platform is driving it closer to parity with the industry\u2019s top all-around brokerage platforms, it remains a top choice for advanced trading techniques and risk management, as well as international trading.For traders planning to make options the main strategy they use to reach their investment goals, tastytrade\u2019s platform and market content are hard to beat. Charles Schwab\u2019s integration of TD Ameritrade's educational programs and trading personalities has produced an unparalleled body of actionable learning materials and live training content for beginners.E*TRADE\u2019s long history of enhancing the user experience continues to shine through with its fantastic mobile apps, while Robinhood makes crypto trading fun and easy for crypto enthusiasts.

Why You Should Trust Us  Investopedia collected 89 criteria that are critical to investors, from 27 online brokerage companies. We used this data to review each brokerage platform for fees, usability, research amenities, and other key features to provide unbiased, comprehensive reviews to ensure our readers make the right decision for their investing needs. Investopedia launched in 1999, and has been helping readers find the best online brokerage accounts since 2019. How to Choose a Brokerage Account  Investors choosing an online broker will find a wide range of options, each with varying product offerings, cost structures, and features. The best broker for you will ultimately depend on your individual goals, priorities, and preferences. Some investors may require advanced platforms with access to niche markets and exotic instruments, while others happily settle for a simple, user-friendly mobile app and cost-effective pricing. Whatever your objectives, here are some key factors to consider when choosing an online broker. Commissions and fees  The commissions and fees your broker charges directly impact your bottom line, and can be a major factor to consider, especially for active traders. Nowadays, with rare exceptions, online brokers offer commission-free stock, ETF, and mutual funds trading, but still charge for options trades. In addition, brokers also generally charge for trading more advanced instruments, like futures, and more exotic asset classes, like cryptocurrencies.\n Available assets and instruments  The breadth of assets and instruments available to trade determines how flexible your investment portfolio or trading strategies can be. Most online brokers offer trading in stocks, ETFs, and options. A sizable number also provides access to futures and mutual funds. A small, but steadily growing group allows clients to trade cryptocurrencies.\u00a0\n Additionally, some brokers now offer fractional shares, which allow investors to buy a portion of high-priced stocks. This feature can be especially helpful for those with smaller accounts, as it makes expensive stocks more accessible. Access to a specific asset class can be a deciding factor when choosing an online broker.\n Your own investing or trading style  Different brokers cater to different trading styles. Whether you manage a long-term stock portfolio, trade complex options strategies, or actively scalp intraday, make sure the platforms and features offered by your broker complement your style and facilitate your trades.\n User experience  A well-designed, intuitive platform can make trading easier and more enjoyable for traders of all levels, but especially for beginners. In recent years, many online brokers have invested significant time and money into making the user experience as seamless as possible.\u00a0Advanced platforms, although improving, may still come with a learning curve due to the amount of instruments and the complexity of tools on offer.\n Research tools  Research tools help investors make better trade decisions. Among others, this may include access to market data, analyst ratings, charting tools, and latest financial reports. Brokers with robust research capabilities may provide traders an edge by offering quicker access to essential market data.\n Educational content  For beginners and experienced investors alike, educational resources are a way to continue improving their knowledge and strategies. A broker offering tutorials, webinars, and in-depth guides can help users stay informed and grow their trading expertise.\n Other key features  Other considerations may include account minimums and benefits, supported order types, customer support accessibility, and premium account offerings.\u00a0Brokers with zero account minimums are more accessible to new investors, while traders with large account balances may benefit from earning interest on unused cash.\u00a0\n Active traders will value a broker\u2019s support of complex order types, and those who trade international markets or cryptocurrencies will appreciate the ability to get customer support 24/7. More recently, some brokers also began offering premium accounts - providing additional services or offering better pricing, usually in exchange for a monthly fee. Such accounts may be beneficial to certain investors.\nFinancial Advisor Insight\"When you're thinking about opening a brokerage or investment account, it\u2019s good to start by considering your goals and how hands-on you want to be,\" said Taylor Kovar, CFP, MBA, a member of\u00a0Investopedia\u2019s Financial Advisor Council. \"Are you looking to invest for something long-term, like retirement or a big purchase, or are you focusing on shorter-term goals? And don\u2019t feel like you have to go all in right away\u2014you can always start small and gradually increase your contributions as you get more comfortable.\" What Is the Difference Between a Full-Service Broker and an Online Broker?  This report identifies the best online brokers and trading platforms. It is natural to ask, \u201cHow do these brokers and platforms differ from full-service brokers?\u201d One key difference is that online brokers cater to do-it-yourself (DIY) investors. In contrast, full-service brokers aim to relieve you of as much heavy financial lifting as possible by shifting it to their own advisors or affiliated experts.\n While online brokers harp on their low costs\u2013not just for trades but also low minimums to open accounts and low costs for access to research, tools, and services\u2013full-service brokers boast of the wide range of their offerings. Those include everything from personal financial planning to insurance, estate planning, retirement planning, accounting services, tax advice, and more.\n Still, the boundary between the two categories of brokers is more and more blurry. Online brokers increasingly offer more services, while full-service brokers increasingly cut costs. In fact, many investors would be hard pressed to explain why some online brokers\u2013especially the larger ones\u2013should not be thought of as full-service firms.\u00a0\nFinancial Advisor InsightCertified financial planner Michael Donnelly, who is account director of corporate relations at the CFP Board of Standards, said, \u201cThe financial services landscape has dramatically changed over the past 30 years. Firms that once served specific clients now compete to keep pace with broader client needs and lower-cost competitors. [Full]-service and online brokers have had to expand their offerings and cut costs to stay competitive. As a result, investors benefit from more similar and competitively priced products across the financial planning ecosystem.\u201d Frequently Asked Questions What Is the Number One Online Stock Broker?The online brokerage industry is a highly competitive space consisting of a wide range of companies, each offering it's own set of features that will appeal differently to individuals. After two months of comprehensive research, Investopedia found that Fidelity offers the best overall online brokerage services and trading platform. Not only did Fidelity earned the highest overall score when measured by our proprietary scoring model it also scored highly for its low costs, excellent ETF selection and research, and for its robust cash management product.\u00a0What Is an Online Brokerage Account and How Does it Work?A brokerage account is a type of account similar in function to the accounts you have with a bank. With a brokerage account, you deposit funds with an investment firm (the brokerage). This is usually done by a transfer from your existing bank account. Once funds are added to your brokerage account, you can put the money to work using the brokerage's trading platform to invest those funds in the market. The assets you buy with your cash can be anything offered by that brokerage, including stocks, bonds, ETFs, and even cryptocurrency.Your online brokerage account will display your holdings (the assets you've purchased) as well as your cash balance (your buying power). If you invest in something that gains in value, you can sell it and the profits will be deposited in your online brokerage account. From there, you can place another trade or even transfer the funds out to your regular bank account to use elsewhere. Some brokerage accounts even allow you to earn interest on your uninvested cash.How Much Money Do you Need to Open a Brokerage Account?There is no longer a real minimum to start investing in the financial markets. With many brokers offering margin accounts with access to fractional shares and no required minimums, you can open and fund an account with any amount of money. If you don't have a lot of money to invest, however, it will influence how you approach the market. Although you could invest $1 in fractional shares of a specific stock, the better approach with limited capital is to use ETFs. Index tracking ETFs, for example, offer greater diversification for your dollar than a single company stock because every share (and fractional share) of the ETF replicates an index made up of many companies in many different industries. You could also consider using options to leverage your dollars with a directional bet on the market or a specific stock, but this is an investment strategy best reserved for risk capital\u2014not the whole of your limited investment capital.When investing with small sums, consistency is the key to building wealth. If you can regularly put a set amount of money into the market\u2014even $10 a week\u2014you will be surprised at how quickly it begins to grow. This consistency also helps to smooth market effects, as you will be buying dips and peaks as the market goes up and down.Can You Invest With a Small Amount of Money?Many online brokers allow for small minimum deposits which can be a great alternative for those with limited funds. Account minimums (if any) are displayed at the top of our reviews, as well as in our selection of the best platforms for different types of investors. If you are looking for more general guidance on investing with limited capital, check out our article on smart investing on a small budget.Do Brokers Offer Mobile Platforms?Some online brokers have powerful mobile apps delivering nearly all the features that their desktop counterparts do. For example, E*TRADE's app, which we picked as our best app for mobile investing and trading, offers two mobile platforms that are streamlined versions of the company's powerful desktop platform.Can You Lose Money in a Brokerage Account?Yes, you can. It is a reality of the market that no reward comes without risk. You can lose money buying a bad investment, but you can also lose by buying a good investment at the wrong time. Investment decisions should be guided by extensive research and careful consideration of your risk tolerance. When it comes to the financial markets, there are endless possibilities for making and losing money. Unless all the funds in your brokerage account are sitting in uninvested cash (brokerage cash accounts are afforded up to $250,000 of protection by Securities Investor Protection Corporation insurance), there is a risk you will lose money.Another way of looking at that, however, is that a brokerage account sitting full of uninvested cash isn't at risk of making any money either. You can use strategies like asset allocation and diversification to reduce the risk of you losing money, but you will never fully eliminate it without also eliminating your chances of making a decent return.Can I Buy Stocks Without a Broker?Yes, you can actually buy and sell stocks without a broker, but it is not a common approach these days. Some companies still offer direct stock purchase plans that allow you to buy shares directly from the company. Companies administer these plans according to internal rules, and some are only open to company employees. You need to contact companies to find out whether they offer a direct stock purchase plan and what the terms and conditions are. These plans initially helped investors avoid brokerage fees, but the rise of online discount brokers with zero fees has removed this barrier, making the direct stock purchase plan somewhat of a relic.What Is the Difference Between Investing and Trading?An important thing to consider is the distinction between investing and trading. When people talk about investing they generally mean buying assets to hold long-term. The goal of investing is to gradually build wealth and reach your retirement goals. Conversely, trading involves short-term strategies that maximize returns on a short-term basis, such as daily or monthly. Trading is generally considered riskier than investing.All these factors are worth considering before choosing an online broker. Do you want to trade or invest? Do you want a great mobile app to check your portfolio wherever you are? What types of assets are you looking to invest in? Answering these questions is not always easy.

{"url": "https://www.investopedia.com/news/how-prime-day-impacts-amazon-stock/", "title": "Does Prime Day Impact Amazon's Stock (AMZN)?", "text": " In each of the years since Prime Day's inception, gross merchandise sales have increased, growing from $0.9 billion in 2015 to $12.09 billion in 2022. But as a $1.3 trillion company with annual revenue of almost half a trillion dollars, sales of $12 billion are not likely to have a major impact on the value of the company as a whole.\n A close look at Amazon's (AMZN) daily price chart since the beginning of the century shows the company has been in an impressive uptrend since well before the launch of Prime Day in 2015. In fact, if we were to look for bumps in share price as a result of Prime Day sales, the result would likely be insignificant at best.Key TakeawaysPrime Day was launched in July 2015 to celebrate 20 years of being in business.In 2021 Amazon had 200 million Prime members worldwide.As $1.3 trillion company with annual revenue of almost half a trillion dollars, Prime Day's sales of $12 billion in 2022 are not likely to have a significant impact on the value of the company as a whole. That's not to say there's no impact. The first Prime Day lasted for 24 hours and included nine countries. Amazon reported that the next Prime Day, which was on July 12, 2016, saw subscriber offers jump 60% from the prior year. The success of Prime Day led to Amazon extending the sale in 2017 to 30 hours.\n In 2018, Amazon added more markets and extended the sale to 36 hours. By 2019, Amazon had expanded the sale to include more countries and two full days. In its 2021 letter to shareholders, Amazon reported that it had 200 million Prime members worldwide.\n On a price-adjusted basis, AMZN was trading at $0.80 at the close of trading on July 15, 2002. By close of trading on July 15, 2022, the adjusted stock price was $113.55 for a price increase of 14,040%. With such impressive sales numbers, it is interesting to look at whether opportunities for short-term traders to take advantage of any bump in share price caused by the effects of Prime Day sales exist.\n Amazon's History  Amazon is one of the most valuable companies in the world, with a market capitalization exceeding $1.3 trillion. The company continued to grow by introducing new products and acquiring complementary businesses. One such product is Amazon Prime. This membership service gives subscribers certain perks like free two-day shipping of products, access to movies, music, and more. Amazon Prime's popularity encouraged the company to add another perk to reward its members. Prime Day was created in July 2015 to celebrate 20 years of being in business. AMZN's Performance Before and After Prime Day Began  There have only been seven Prime Day sales events, constituting too small a number to reach any statistically significant conclusions. But nevertheless, it is interesting to look at the stock price before and after Prime Day for any short-term tradable price action.\n If you were to buy the shares of AMZN at the close on the day prior to the first Prime Day sales and hold for a period ranging from one day, five days (one week) and 20 days (one month) after Prime Day, would there be any appreciable difference in price from the period a month earlier? AMZN Prime Day Short-Term Returns  The first table below shows the profits or losses to be gained from buying shares of AMZN at the close prior to Prime Day and then selling at the close one day, five days (one week), or 20 days (one month) after Prime Day. The results are not impressive and produce a combined loss for all time periods. If your trading strategy had been to buy at the close the day before Prime for the last seven years and sell one day, one week, or one month later. Each time period results in negative returns.\n The second table moves the time that shares are purchased approximately one month before Prime Day in each of the seven years. This is to provide a comparison of a random time frame. We can see that this random time period produces slightly better results across all time frames. (When dates fall on a weekend, days are moved back or forward to the next tradable day). For the one-day strategy, the average results are slightly better at $0.65 than the results for the post-Prime period at -$1.53. For the one-week strategy, the results are also slightly better than the post-Prime period at -$6.26 as opposed to -$10.81. The most impressive results are for the pre-Prime period of holding for one month at gains of $35.81 as opposed to the losses in the post-Prime period of -$8.27.Post Prime Day Trades\u00a0Date\u00a01 Day\u00a05 Days\u00a010 Days\u00a07/13/2015\u00a01.08\u00a02.23\u00a04.02\u00a07/12/2016\u00a0-0.56\u00a00.69\u00a00.73\u00a07/10/2017\u00a00.77\u00a01.56\u00a00.67\u00a07/16/2018\u00a01.50\u00a00.81\u00a05.33\u00a07/15/2019\u00a00.05\u00a0-1.27\u00a0-11.30\u00a010/13/2020\u00a0-5.22\u00a0-12.90\u00a0-15.28\u00a06/21/2021\u00a00.85\u00a0-1.93\u00a07.56\u00a0TOTAL\u00a0-1.53\u00a0-10.81\u00a0-8.27Table Shows Results of Prime Day Trading Strategy for Three Different Time Periods.\n\nPre-Prime Day Trades\u00a0Date\u00a01 Day\u00a05 Days\u00a010 Days\u00a06/13/2015\u00a0-0.14\u00a00.31\u00a01.78\u00a06/12/2016\u00a00.07\u00a0-0.20\u00a01.51\u00a06/10/2017\u00a00.12\u00a00.84\u00a00.79\u00a06/16/2018\u00a00.39\u00a0-0.02\u00a05.32\u00a06/15/2019\u00a01.00\u00a02.08\u00a07.57\u00a09/13/2020\u00a0-0.66\u00a0-8.06\u00a08.52\u00a05/21/2021\u00a0-0.13\u00a0-1.23\u00a010.32\u00a0TOTAL\u00a00.65\u00a0-6.28\u00a035.81Trades are Moved One Calendar Month Back for Comparison\n\n Prime's Impact on Amazon  Amazon is a juggernaut. Even though Prime Day sales of $12 billion in 2022 seem impressive. It is worth noting that the total revenue for this company in 2021 was $469,822,000. $12 billion is less than 3% of its total revenue. From this perspective it makes sense that the impact of Prime Day sales on the company's share price would be insignificant at best. The Bottom Line  It is useful to remember that the stock market acts as a forward-looking discounting mechanism. This means that the market will usually incorporate all publicly available information into the price of the stock. By the time the news is out about a particular event that had been anticipated by the market, it is usually too late to profit from it. Shocks to the market and individual stock prices usually happen when information that had not been expected occurs.\n", "tags": ["www.investopedia.com", "news", "wwwinvestopediacom"]}

The Bermuda Stock Exchange (BSX) is a stock exchange headquartered in Hamilton, Bermuda. The exchange got its start in 1971 and is one of the largest offshore electronic securities markets in the world.\n The exchange is recognized by the World Federation of Exchanges, as well as by governments and exchange commissions around the world. The U.S. Securities and Exchanges Commission recognizes the BSX, as does the Australian government, the London Stock Exchange, and the Canadian Department of Finance.\n Securities traded on the BSX include stocks from domestic and international companies, government debt, and insurance-linked securities.\n The legal currency in Bermuda is the Bermudian dollar, which is pegged to the U.S. dollar.\n Understanding the Bermuda Stock Exchange (BSX)  The Bermuda Stock Exchange promotes itself as an attractive place to list hedge funds, derivative warrants, equities, and investment fund structures. Its regulations for listing reflect a generally accepted international standard.\n For example, the exchange expects all issuers to disclose relevant information to the public to allow investors to make informed decisions. The exchange also requires that the directors of an issuing company act in the best interests of security holders as a whole and treat all holders of securities fairly and as equals.\n Generally, the BSX requires an applying issuer to have a sponsor that is either a listing member or trading sponsor of the exchange. When an issuer seeks to attain a primary listing on the exchange for equity securities, its sponsor must be a trading member.\n The sponsor\u2019s role is to ensure that the applying issuer receives guidance and advice that is fair and that the issuer completes the application fully, submitting all necessary paperwork and serving as a communication liaison to the exchange during the application.\n Issuers Listed on the BSX  Listings on the BSX include a variety of both domestic and international companies. Domestic companies include three utility companies. These are Ascendant Group Ltd, One Communications, and Watlington Waterworks. The Bermuda Press is the only domestic publishing company listed on the exchange.\n Other domestic companies listed on the exchange include Argus insurance group, Bank of N.T. Butterfield, Bermuda Aviation Services, and West Hamilton Holdings.\n International issuers listed on the exchange include Zeno Capital Limited, HongKong Land Holdings, United Pharmaceuticals International, and Apollo Enterprise Solutions.\n The exchange issues daily trading reports, available to the public electronically. These reports list the share volume and turnover on the exchange as well as the bid prices, asking prices, market capitalization, and other relevant figures of listed issuers.\u00a0\n", "tags": ["www.investopedia.com", "terms", "wwwinvestopediacom"]}

{"url": "https://www.investopedia.com/articles/stocks/08/medical-tech-investment.asp", "title": "A Checklist for Medical Technology Investments", "text": " What Is the Medical Technology Industry?  The medical technology industry, commonly known as medtech, is made up of companies that develop, design, produce, and sell medical technologies, equipment, and health care information systems.\n Its impact on the care and well-being of patients and the efficiency and effectiveness of providers has been, and continues to be, substantial.\n Medtech offers investors substantial growth potential, strong returns on capital, government-enforced restrictions on competition,\u00a0and products that can be essential to maintaining people's quality of life.\n At the same time, it has its challenges. Companies face major upfront development expenses, a high failure rate, a constant stream of would-be rivals and a federal regulatory body that enforces strict, and sometimes arbitrary, standards.\n As of 2024, medtech was a $587 billion industry. Compound annual growth of revenue from late 2019 to the end of 2023 was 8.3%. As with any investment, you should be sure to conduct your due diligence before investing. With that, here is a checklist of five pointers that may help your investment decision-making in the dynamic medical technology industry.\nKey TakeawaysThe medtech industry offers impressive profit potential but faces major, ongoing challenges.Industry advantages include strong returns on capital, government-enforced restrictions on competition,\u00a0and the public's desire for products that can maintain or enhance quality of life.As of 2024, medtech was a $587 billion industry.Research and development, new products in the pipeline, and FDA approval are keys to a medical technology company's success.Generally, medtech stocks have outperformed the S&P 500 over time. 1. Look for an Innovator, Not a Follower  When considering a potential medical technology investment, it's generally better to look for a company dedicated to new technologies and innovation.\n Take Note of R&D and New Products  New products typically offer better performance (better outcomes for the patient, easier for the doctor to use and so on). Such improvements typically command a premium price and drive market-share shifts to the new product.\n The best way to assess whether a given company is focused on innovation is to look at the company's product pipeline and research and development (R&D)\u00a0efforts.\n Small companies are generally upfront about their projects currently underway (often it's the only thing management has to talk about with investors).\n However, large companies don't often disclose much information of this type. In those cases, try this rule of thumb: If a company is spending less than 10% of its revenue on R&D, be suspicious.\n 2. Don't Sweat the Details  Expert medical knowledge isn't required for medtech investing. In fact, even the smartest medical minds have a mixed record when it comes to seeing the future of medical technologies.\n So investors should never feel intimidated by a medical expert's potentially complicated or obscure take on a given stock or therapy.\n It is certainly worthwhile to read up on the conditions that a company's products are intended to treat. Go online to find a wealth of information on almost every medical condition that constitutes a viable market opportunity.\n From peer-reviewed journal papers to individual patient blogs, any investor can get a sense of the driving factors in the treatment of any medical condition.\nFast FactOngoing medtech innovation has improved health care with technologies and products that have resulted in better informed patients, earlier and more accurate diagnoses, greater choices of treatments, less invasive surgeries, and cost reductions. 3. Understand the Life Cycle  There are several key points in a medtech company's life cycle, and each stage has certain ramifications for an investor.\n1.Startup companies often face years of losses and cash outflows as management tries to lead new products through clinical trials and regulators,\u00a0and onto the market.\n The amount of cash on the balance sheet, the efficacy of the product, and the candor of the management team are crucial. Assuming that the clinical data is positive, the company will eventually face the FDA and the thumbs-up/thumbs-down decision that follows.\n2. If a company secures FDA approval, the next stage is the marketing launch and sales ramp. At this stage, it is critical for the company to have a solid marketing team in place. Look for strong initial sales growth, but don't expect profits just yet.\n3. Once a company achieves profitability, the game changes. Simply put, very few medtech companies ever mature into large, independent players.\n For the most part, companies are acquired or turn to buying companies themselves. That means investors should keep an eye on deals and take note of companies that overpay in their attempts to grow through acquisitions.\n4. For those companies that do establish themselves as large, independent players, this stage is a continuous process of managing the existing business, introducing new products, and shepherding the growth of shareholder value.\nImportantIn 2024, greater medtech industry growth was seen as highly possible, especially in certain niches, such as cardiovascular therapeutics. 4. Watch for Government Actions  If there is a risk factor to medical technology that's not common to other companies, it is the significant potential impact of the U.S. government on businesses in this industry.\n FDA Approval  The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) effectively determines whether a company can do business in the U.S. Before a device can be sold legally, the FDA has to approve its sale.\n While not all product approvals require expensive clinical trials, most of the products that drive significant revenue growth for the industry do require substantial data on efficacy and safety before the FDA permits their sale. FDA Monitoring  In addition, the FDA requires ongoing monitoring and reporting and can order devices off the market if hidden dangers reveal themselves in subsequent years. The FDA has a mandate to protect the safety of the general public, but the proper tradeoff between the risk and reward of a new device or therapy is subjective.\n Complicating matters, the attitude of the FDA regarding that tradeoff seems to ebb and flow over time.\n Investors can minimize the risks to their portfolio by choosing companies that either have a suite of approved products already on the market\u00a0or that have very strong data for products under development.\n Influencing Payment  The government also plays a role in determining if medical technology companies get paid for their devices and therapies.\nMedicare is a major factor when it comes to how Americans pay for their health care. If the government pulls back on how much it's willing to pay for various therapies or devices, that can affect the sector.\n In fact, private insurers will often take a cue from Medicare when they form their own coverage policies.\n 5. Accept a Different Valuation Standard  The valuation standards in medical technology are a little different from those in other industries. If you look at many of the bellwether medical technology stocks, such as Alcon (ACL), Stryker (SYK), Boston Scientific (BSX) and Medtronic (MDT), you will see historical ratios above (and sometimes well above) the prevailing S&P 500 Index\u00a0levels. These ratios include:\nPrice-to-earningsPrice-to-bookPrice-to-salesPrice-to-cash flowEV/EBITDA (EV = enterprise value) Over time, medtech stocks have generally outperformed the S&P\u00a0500\u00a0and held up relatively well in periods of difficult broader-market performance.\n There are arguments in favor of more-robust valuations; this industry sports above-average margins and return on invested capital, doesn't fear generic competitors, and offers products with pretty inelastic demand. After all, a person may be able to delay buying a new car or TV until the economy gets better, but they can't delay treating a heart attack or broken hip.\n Investors new to medical technology should also realize that, for better or worse, the price-to-sales ratio is a commonly used metric for these stocks (particularly at the small-cap and mid-cap levels).\n In fact, emerging medtech stocks trading below a price-to-sales ratio of 4 may be regarded as a buy,\u00a0and those trading above 8 or so may be regarded as overpriced or at least overheated.\nWho Are Big Players in Medtech in 2025?Major medtech companies include Abbott Laboratories (ABT), Becton Dickinson (BDX), Boston Scientific Corp. (BSX), and Stryker (SYK).What Is the Focus of Medtech in 2025?In 2025, it's expected that the larger companies will focus on artificial intelligence, R&D, product differentiation, and medical device portability.How Do I Invest in Medtech?You can research and invest in individual medical technology companies. Or, you might consider medtech exchange-traded funds that may simplify your efforts and offer you instant diversification in the industry. The Bottom Line  Medical technology is a dynamic industry, with new technologies and products emerging virtually every year. Some investors avoid it because they believe that it's too complicated to understand.\n It may take some time and effort to get up to speed on medical technology companies and their stocks. But if an investor methodically researches and assesses the overall industry and individual medtech stocks, they can then decide with confidence whether medtech is a good fit for their portfolios.\n", "tags": ["www.investopedia.com", "articles", "wwwinvestopediacom"]}

Interactions between these structural elements generate convergences and divergences that allow observant traders to make predictions about direction, relative strength or weakness, and the durability of market turns.\n Price-volume relationships are especially useful in identifying bottoms because profit potential peaks when long positions can be entered at or near the lowest low in a downtrend. Rather than catching a falling knife, the volume-focused trader acts early on technical signs that show committed buyers are returning to a once-depressed security.\nKey TakeawaysPrice and volume are key tools for identifying market bottoms and peaks.When using volume in a downtrend, it's important to look at the downtrend at certain intervals to see how it fits the bottoming scenario.Two key methods for finding volumes involve looking at volume histograms and on balance volume (OBV).However, it remains difficult to call market bottoms with absolute certainty.  Reading Volume in Downtrends  To read volume in downtrends, examine the downtrend at periodic intervals to see how it fits into a bottoming scenario. Focus on coincident volume activity that measures the balance between buyers and sellers, throwing out any ambiguous signals. Divergences are useful in this process, especially when looking for hidden buying interest that isn\u2019t reflected in the current price activity.\n Directional pressure can be easily evaluated through most phases of a downtrend because volume indicators will show sellers overwhelming buyers, or the exact opposite of the scenario expected at the bottom. In addition to trade flow, look at average volume day-to-day as the downtrend progresses because bottoms rarely form until one of two events takes place:\nThe security undergoes a climactic sell-off that leads to three to five times the average daily volume, often over many sessions.The security enters a dormant phase where it continues to fall while volume dries up, leading to lower-than-average daily volume, often for weeks or months. The first scenario triggers a buying imbalance because intense selling pressure reduces the supply of new sellers, giving buyers an advantage, while the second scenario indicates that sellers have moved on to other opportunities, allowing value players to start the process of bottom building. It is counterintuitive, but a security in a low-volume decline will often take longer to show a durable bottom than one in a climactic free-fall.\n Finding Bottoms With Volume Histograms Volume histograms found at the bottom of most price charts do a good job of identifying and confirming bottoms when analyzed correctly. In the first scenario, the trader looks for a selling climax that yields one or more high-volume bounces that indicate short covering.\n This price and volume activity doesn\u2019t signal an immediate bottom or new uptrend. Rather, it forms the outline of a bottom that can take additional weeks or months to complete.\n A bullish volume shift can be harder to find in the second scenario because beaten-down securities can drift sideways to lower for months before acquiring the sponsorship needed to enter a new uptrend.\n New money often enters quietly in these patterns, triggering slightly higher than normal buying days within long-term trading ranges. These upticks don\u2019t trigger breakouts and are often ignored by technicians because they don\u2019t stand out on the price chart.\n However, the total of this buying activity builds a positive feedback loop that carries the price up to a notable resistance level. A high volume breakout often follows immediately, shocking chart watchers who haven\u2019t paid attention to the small details. As a result, watching this quiet accumulation and entering a trade at range resistance can produce outstanding profits.\n Three Year Low Volume\u00a0Bottoming Pattern Image by Sabrina Jiang \u00a9 Investopedia\u00a02021 Boston Scientific Corp. (BSX) dipped under the 2008 bear market low in 2010, entering a bottoming pattern that lasted for more than two years. Weekly volume dropped precipitously in 2011 and 2012, pointing to extreme apathy in the middle of a raging bull market.\n The security quietly carved out a weekly descending triangle, breaking the upper trendline and 50-week exponential moving average (EMA) in January 2013, setting off a new uptrend that showed rapid progress.\n In both scenarios, watch the volume when the price finally rolls over and tests the downtrend low. It\u2019s bullish when the test generates lower volume and the price turns higher above the prior low. Undercuts to new lows are common in our modern environment, but these can still yield legitimate bottoms when volume aligns correctly and price recovers quickly, closing back above the prior low.\n Finding Bottoms With On Balance Volume (OBV) On balance volume (OBV) offers a useful technical tool to gauge the durability of a potential bottom. Watch the indicator during the test of the prior low, looking for it to carve out a higher low. This pattern can draw wide attention, encouraging sidelined participants to open long positions in support of a new uptrend.\n Trading a Bullish Volume Divergence Image by Sabrina Jiang \u00a9 Investopedia\u00a02021 It\u2019s especially valuable when the price dips below the prior low while OBV holds above it, signaling a bullish divergence. That\u2019s what happened on the Expeditors International of Washington, Inc. (EXPD) chart after the security fell more than eight points over three months. The higher OBV print revealed hidden buying interest, ahead of a recovery wave that returns to the yearly high.\nHow Do You Identify the Bottom of a Market?There are a few ways to determine the bottom of a market. The two most important are price and volume. When there are few sellers in the market for a stock, it has probably bottomed out. Additionally, if the average daily trading volume of a stock has dropped significantly, it has most likely bottomed out.What Does Market Volume Data Mean?Volume refers to how often an asset is bought and sold over a given time frame. If an asset is bought and sold many times, it will have a high volume. Volume is a signal of liquidity and activity. The higher the volume, the more liquid an asset is.What Is the Most Useful Volume Indicator?There are two common volume indicators: positive volume index (PVI) and negative volume index (NVI). PVI measures increases in trading volume whereas NVI measures decreases in trading volume. The Bottom Line  Market bottoms often carve out classic volume patterns that let observant traders make fast and accurate calls, allowing them to get on board before the crowd discovers the new uptrend.\n Keep in mind that it's difficult to call market bottoms with absolute certainty. Use the methods listed here in conjunction with the other techniques for determining if a stock has bottomed to minimize risks and potentially earn a significant profit.\n", "tags": ["www.investopedia.com", "articles", "wwwinvestopediacom"]}
{"url": "https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/freeriding.asp", "title": "Freeriding: Definition, How It Works, Legality, and Example", "text": " What Is Freeriding?  The term freeriding refers to the practice of buying shares or other securities in a cash account and then selling them before the purchase has settled. When a trader freerides, they may pay for the shares using money from the proceeds of the sale instead of cash. Freeriding is a violation of the Federal Reserve Board's Regulation T and may result in the suspension of the trader's account.Key TakeawaysFreeriding is the practice of buying shares and then selling them before the purchase is fully settled.Freeriding is a violation of Regulation T, which governs how investors can use their cash accounts.There must be enough capital in an investor's cash account to buy securities before they are sold, according to Regulation T.Brokers and dealers must suspend or restrict cash accounts for 90 days if a trader is suspected of freeriding.A trader may commit freeriding even when they have enough money to pay for the trade if they sell a stock before the purchase is settled. Understanding Freeriding Regulation T (Reg T) is a series of provisions that govern how investors can use their cash accounts when they trade, as well as how much credit they can receive from brokers and dealers to execute their trades. One of the federal regulations stipulated by the Fed under Reg T is that investors must have enough capital in their cash accounts to buy securities before they are sold.\n Freeriding usually happens when a trader buys and sells a security without having enough capital in their account to cover the purchase. But how is that possible? Different securities have different settlement dates following a transaction. This is expressed as T plus the number of days it takes to settle. For instance:\nStock and\u00a0exchange-traded fund (ETF) transactions settle in two business days (T+2)Mutual fund and\u00a0options transactions settle in one day (T+1) Let's say a trader buys shares in a company. The sale settles two days after the date of purchase. When they sell their shares, their account is almost always credited immediately with the proceeds. The trader can then use those proceeds to cover the original purchase when it settles. Basically, the trader sells the shares before they actually buy them.\nFast FactFreeriding also refers to an illegal practice involving an underwriting syndicate member who withholds part of a new securities issue and later sells it at a higher price. This practice is illegal and is prohibited by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA). Brokers and dealers must freeze any cash account they suspect of freeriding for a 90-day period. When an account is restricted, a trader may still buy securities, but the purchase must be done using cash on the very same day rather than on the settlement date.\n Traders may be unintentionally guilty of freeriding if they buy securities with the proceeds of a sale that has not been finalized. For example, imagine a trader who sells $100 of a stock and uses the proceeds to buy another stock the following day. Since stock trades take two business days after the sale to settle, that trader was freeriding, because the first sale would not have been finalized for an additional business day. Under federal regulatory guidelines, their cash account should be frozen for 90 days. As mentioned above, investment bankers and broker-dealers who act as an underwriting syndicate may also be in violation of freeriding when they keep shares from an initial public offering (IPO) aside so they can sell them for a higher price at a future date.\n Special Considerations  You can commit freeriding even if you have enough cash to pay for a purchase. Under the law, freeriding describes any sale that takes effect before the purchase is settled, whether or not the trader already has enough funds on hand. Traders can use a margin account to avoid the potential of freeriding while you trade. A margin account is a loan issued to an investor by a broker or dealer so they can conduct trades. The securities purchased using the account and any cash deposited by the investor act as collateral. In turn, the investor agrees to pay a certain amount of interest on the loan.\n Investors who trade in\u00a0broker-administered\u00a0margin accounts\u00a0are less likely to have trouble because the\u00a0broker lends the customer cash to cover the transaction, thereby providing\u00a0protection against freeriding violations.\nImportantInvestors who don't fully understand the regulations may inadvertently violate freeriding laws, so it's important to do your research before you begin trading. Example of Freeriding  Here's a hypothetical example to show how freeriding works. Let's say you own shares of Boston Scientific (BSX) and (for simplicity's sake) you have no other holdings or cash in your account. On Monday, you decide to sell shares. You then use the cash from the sale to buy shares of\u00a0Johnson & Johnson (JNJ)\u00a0on the same day. Then, you decide to sell the JNJ shares on Tuesday\u2014a full day before the sale of your BSX shares settles.\n Because settlement for the BSX transaction did not occur until Wednesday (T+2), there was no cash to cover the purchase of JNJ and the sale of those shares. To avoid freeriding, the investor would have had to wait until after settlement (Thursday) before offloading the JNJ shares.\n As this\u00a0example\u00a0illustrates, active traders could easily find themselves in violation of freeriding rules\u00a0if they do not fully understand cash account trading rules.\u00a0One of the biggest problems with freeriding is that many investors don't know they're doing it or that the possibility of doing something like this is illegal. For this reason, it is important to become familiar with how freeriding works,\u00a0as well as with the SEC rules that prohibit the practice.\nCorrection\u2013Feb. 27, 2022:This article has been edited to highlight some circumstances where freeriding can occur.Correction\u2013Feb. 10, 2023: A previous version of this article misstated the settlement date or BSX in the example. This was corrected to read Wednesday instead of Thursday.", "tags": ["www.investopedia.com", "terms", "wwwinvestopediacom"]}

Furthermore, exciting advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) and high-powered analytics applications continue to push product development boundaries and drive innovation. Consulting firm KPMG predicts global annual sales in the medical device industry to reach almost $800 billion by 2030.\n Strong fourth quarter earnings this week from industry-leading names such as Align Technology, Inc. (ALGN) and Stryker Corporation (SYK) have led several stocks in the space to break out above continuation patterns such as flags and pennants toward their 52-week highs.\n Let's take a closer look at key technical levels for three medical device stocks on the verge of a 12-month breakout.\n Abbott Laboratories (ABT)  Abbott Laboratories (ABT), with a market capitalization of $128.18 billion, develops, manufactures and markets medical devices, nutritional health care products, diagnostic equipment and generic pharmaceuticals. The company's fourth quarter (Q4) medical device sales led organic growth, with diabetes care, structural heart and electrophysiology revenue advancing 32.4%, 15.2% and 18.7%, respectively. Overall, the segment grew 9% in the quarter to $2.92 billion. Abbot stock offers a 1.79% dividend yield and is down 0.46% year to date (YTD) as of Feb. 1, 2019. Analysts have a 12-month price target on the stock at $79.55 \u2013 9% above Thursday's $72.98 closing price.\n Abbott's share price has traded within a 10-point range since October. Although still oscillating within the trading range, the stock has recently broken above a consolidation area resembling a flag pattern, suggesting that it wants to test the 52-week high at $74.57. If the price can't push through this level, look for a fall back to the long-term uptrend line that offers support at $67.\nStockCharts.com Edwards Lifesciences Corporation (EW)  California-based Edwards Lifesciences Corporation (EW) manufactures and sells medical devices and equipment to treat structural heart disease. Its principal products include surgical tissue heart valves, catheters and retractors, and monitoring equipment. The company generates roughly half of its revenue outside the United States. Edwards Lifesciences' Q4 net sales climbed 10% to $977.7 million, surpassing the Street's expectations of $976 million, although its outlook for the first quarter (Q1) fell shy of analysts' expectations. As of Feb. 1, 2019, the company's stock is up over 10% YTD, outperforming the medical devices industry average by 3.27% over the same period.\n Edwards Lifesciences' chart shows a weak but steady uptrend over the past 12 months. The stock pushed slightly above a tight pennant pattern in Thursday trade that indicates an imminent run to the 2018 high at $175. Also, a relative strength index (RSI) reading below 70.0 gives the price plenty of room to move higher. Should price falter, bears may send the stock back toward $147.50, where it finds support from a long term trendline and the 200-day simple moving average (SMA).\nStockCharts.com Boston Scientific Corporation (BSX)  Boston Scientific Corporation (BSX) produces minimally invasive medical devices for blood clot filtration, cardiac rhythm management and structural heart disease as well as other specialty areas. The company, which has beaten earnings estimates in three out of the past four quarters, reports its Q4 results on Feb. 6, and it expects total year-over-year revenue growth of 6.3%, in line with consensus estimates. Full-year 2019 mean revenue growth is projected to be 14.4%. Boston Scientific stock, with a market cap of $52.79 billion, has returned nearly 8% this year as of Feb. 1, 2019.\n After a moderate uptrend for the first nine months of 2018, Boston Scientific's share price slowly retraced back toward the 200-day SMA before starting its current leg higher in late December. The stock broke out from a pennant during yesterday's trading session and looks like it may test the 52-week high at $39.44 set in October last year. A stall here could see the price fall back to the $34 level, where it finds support from the 200-day SMA and a horizontal line connecting previous price action.\nStockCharts.comDo you have a news tip for Investopedia reporters?

{"url": "https://www.investopedia.com/8-low-beta-growth-stocks-that-can-lead-amid-market-s-turmoil-4771390", "title": "8 'Low Beta' Growth Stocks That Can Lead Amid Market's Turmoil", "text": " Investors seeking growth stocks that can outperform amid high global risk and uncertainty should consider buying \"low beta\" growth plays, including Facebook Inc. (FB), Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL), Boston Scientific Corp. (BSX), Medtronic PLC (MDT), Dollar General Corp. (DG) Intercontinental Exchange Inc. (ICE), NextEra Energy Inc.\u00a0(NEE), and Diamondback Energy Inc. (FANG), according to a study by UBS strategist Francois Trahan, as reported in Barron's.\nGrowth stocks have lagged the broader S&P 500 Index (SPX) in September, as momentum trades have begun to falter. However, based on his analysis of the last two decades, Trahan finds that lower beta growth stocks outperform higher beta growth stocks when investors become more risk averse, as they did in 2007, 2011, and 2015. Valuation, meanwhile, does not appear to be relevant. \u201cIn most cases, the better performing Growth stocks happened to have higher valuations, which did not seem to be a driver of performance,\u201d Tranhan wrote in a note to clients, as quoted by Barron's.\n Significance for Investors  For the month-to-date through Sept. 25, 2019, the S&P 500 Growth Index was up by a scant 0.60%, versus a 3.64% gain for the S&P 500 Value Index, and a 2.00% advance for the S&P 500 Index (SPX) as a whole, per S&P Dow Jones Indices. Some Wall Street strategists theorize that the bottoming out of yields on U.S. Treasury securities is driving the rotation, Bloomberg reports. Rising fears about a recession sent yields down, and investors sought refuge in growth and high dividend stocks. Now yields are up, recessionary fears are waning, and investors are reversing those defensive trades.\n Beta is a measure of volatility that compares a stock's historic price swings to those in the market as a whole. A beta of less than 1.0 indicates that the stock tends to go up and down less than the market. For example, a beta of 0.5 means that, on average, the percentage change in that stock's price tends to be half the percentage change in the market as a whole, as measured by an index such as the S&P 500.\n A beta in excess of 1.0 indicates that the stock is more volatile than the market. For example, a beta of 2.0 means that the stock tends to exhibit price swings that are double the movement in the market index.\n Boston Scientific has buy or strong ratings from 18 of the 24 analysts covering it, or 75%, per Yahoo Finance. Their average price target is $48.23, or XX% above the close on Sept. 26, 2019. The company is a leading manufacturer of medical devices and instruments, particular in the area of cardiovascular health. Management is projecting organic revenue growth of 6% to 9% annually through 2022, and an operating margin at 27% by 2020, on the path to a long-term goal of 30%, per Valuentum Securities writing in Seeking Alpha.\n Medtronic has buy or strong buy ratings from 11 of 23 analysts, or 52%, per Yahoo Finance. Their average price target is $117.65, or XX above the Sept. 26 close. Also a leading maker of medical devices, especially heart devices, Medtronic is a top player in other areas as well. The company has a high gross profit margin of nearly 70%, strong cash flow, and is expanding rapidly in emerging markets, where revenues are growing at about 12% per annum and represent about 16% of total sales, according to a column in Seeking Alpha.\n Looking Ahead  Stocks with high returns on capital are among the \"quality\" equities that Goldman Sachs notes are trading at reasonable valuations. In particular, they recommend that investors focus on stocks with high expected rates of increase in return on equity (ROE), per their latest US Weekly Kickstart report.\nDo you have a news tip for Investopedia reporters?
